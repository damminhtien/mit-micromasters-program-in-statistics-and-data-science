This is just straight up peanut butter without any frills (well, it is after you mix water into it anyway). Personally, I like it, and besides, there is plenty sugar in jelly anyway if you are gonna eat a PB&J using this, which I do from time to time. For me, it's primary use is in smoothies though. This powder is perfect for that. It blends thoroughly and you dont get all that aforementioned sugar and oil (and usually transfats) that comes with using most normal peanut butters, which basically means you arent adding junk to your diet. I would recommend however that if you planning to use this exclusively for sandwiches and are concerned about the lack of sweetness, that you try a brand like Justin's instead.

In the past year, however, I made about 11 kits from different manufactures.<br /><br />This wine, Tuscany Rosso Magnifico, is quite fantastic.  I made it at 5 gallons by putting in all of the juice concentrate, but only re-constituting with water up to the 5 gallon mark.  I also added 30 Grams of Oak Chips.  Now, I personally don't like a lot of oak in a wine.  For that reason, I don't like many commercial wines...  30 Grams of Oak is enough not to actually taste excessive oak, but have a better mouth feel.  I got the oak from a home brew close to where I live.  Medium Toasted Oak.  Again, it is just my opinion, but less is more with the oak... You should trust your tongue, and not worry about what others say.  You can always add more oak, you can't take it away...<br /><br />I put the oak in the carboy for the secondary fermentation.  Not in the bucket.  I learned that from copying a Mosti Mondale kit.  Some kits but oak dust in the primary...

But, you will most likely not be able to wait that long....  Put 3 or 4 bottles away to age, if you can't wait for the whole batch...<br /><br />To learn about the process, I learned everything I know from looking at the videos on the finevinewines.com website.

       "  'text': 'These 1.5 oz fruit and nut bars have excellent taste.  I\\'ve never been much of a fan of other snack bars I\\'ve tried, but I can say that this was really quite impressive.  The first ingredient listed on the package is almonds and that flavor was very noticeable for me.  The peanuts also add a distinct taste.  (The picture on the wrapper shows cashews and walnuts, but they are not in the ingredient listing and I did not find them in the bar.)  The two types of nuts combined with the chia and sunflower seeds and agave fiber provide any \"crunch\" you might be expecting.  I could not specifically see or taste the blueberry and cranberry fruits, but they are definitely there.  The pomegranate seeds are very visible.  The flavors all meld very well.  There was just enough individual nut flavor and the fruit combination provided the sweetness.  I did notice that the second ingredient is brown rice syrup, but since the bar is not overly sweet I think most of the sweet flavor comes from the fruits.<br /><br />At 190 calories per bar this seems to be a snack you would want to keep track of to make sure you don\\'t eat too many simply because they are so good, especially since 100 of those calories come from the fats.  I did find that the bar was rather sticky.  In fact, it has been quite a chore getting the bar separated from the wrapper so that I can eat it.  Then I\\'m left holding a sticky bar.  To counteract that you can simply hold the bottom of the bar by the wrapper as you eat it.  That brings me to one aspect of the bars which I\\'m not completely happy about.  Since the bar is sticky I chose to cut it into bite size pieces.  Anyone with any dental concerns at all will want to be careful when biting into this very dense, sticky bar.  And, if you are like me and have teeth set very close together, the seeds from the blueberries and cranberries can be a real challenge.  I find myself needing to use dental floss after eating each bar.  Hopefully that will not be an area of concern for you.<br /><br />If you\\'ve read this far you will have noticed the word \"sticky\" used quite often in my review.  That\\'s because that was an issue for me and for my husband.  The taste is delicious.  The fact that most of the ingredients are organic is certainly a plus.  The vegan and gluten free aspects are going to be very valuable to some consumers.  Certainly I would say that this is a quality product.'},\n",

Realizing that they really just wanted my money, I decided to switch his food.  I decided to go with Canadae ALS. During the transition, BlackJack was still having a loose stool. After more research, I finally decided on Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. I started mixing this food and BJ developed a very bad bloody diarrhea case.  I started the \"at home remedy\" of pepto bismol and a bland diet.  The pet store clerk recommended some canned pumpkin as well.  BJ fasted for 24 hours.  After feeding him boiled chicken & rice for a few days, the blood gradually disappeared. I slowly started mixing the Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. All i can say is BJ is feeling 100% better and his stool is solid!!!

Before I go on, be aware that there are less expensive ways of getting a grapefruit flavored drink.  For example, you could drink Ocean Spray\\'s grapefruit drinks, which include several varieties.  Crystal Light also makes a grapefruit drink.  Lots of options exist that do not contain the caffeine of this energy supplement.

I felt a bit light-headed rather than energetic.  I even felt a little sleepy, perhaps because of all the calories.  All that caffeine also seemed to require a number of trips to the restroom, and my mouth felt dry.

       "  'text': 'I have a 35-pound 6-month old Keeshond, who I would classify as a \"moderate\" chewer. I bought her this bone because she enjoys chewing things with a little bit of \"give,\" and the Durachew Nylabones seemed to be too hard to hold her interest for extended periods. Indeed, after some insecurity about this bone, my Keeshond took to it just fine. She seemed to enjoy lying on the floor, munching away on it for several minutes at a time. After the first session, I saw that her favorite chewing end had begun to fray, but the instructions stated that such fraying is normal and that the surface of the bone is designed to fragment into small pieces the size of a grain of rice, which are miniscule enough to pass through the dog\\'s digestive tract without creating any dangerous or life-threatening obstructions.<br /><br />However, after only a couple more chewing sessions, I noticed that her favorite chewing end was wearing down to the point that nearly an entire nub was gone. Luckily for both of us, I never left her unattended while she was chewing on this bone. Earlier today, during one of her play sessions with the bone, I looked down and saw the bone lying on the floor, with my dog standing above it chewing on and trying to swallow something. The thing she was chewing on fell out of her mouth and I quickly swooped in to pick it up: It was a piece of the bone, substantially larger than a \"grain of rice\"--about an inch long by half an inch wide. Though I cannot say for sure that a piece of such size could cause a bowel obstruction, I did not want to take any chances. The packaging advises the dog owner to throw the bone away as soon as large pieces begin to break off, and I did just that.<br /><br />Look. My dog is not a Pit Bull. She is a Keeshond. Keeshonden are not known for being aggressive chewers. And, although I will concede that my dog definitely enjoys chewing on things, she is not more of a chewer than an average dog, and there is no world in which she can be considered a \"powerful\" chewer. This bone only lasted for a week of occasional chewing? It should have stood up to more punishment. I only gave it a second star because my dog genuinely seemed to like chewing on it. Otherwise, I consider this bone a safety hazard.<br /><br />If you do choose to buy this bone, make sure you always supervise your dog when he is chewing it so that you can stop him if he starts to break larger pieces off. The instructions probably only give this warning for the purpose of waiving the company\\'s liability, but they are right.'},\n",

If you\\'re consuming this, you\\'re probably not particularly interested in drinking a milkshake (If you are, go to the Mickey Dees and grab a big ol\\' glass of milk and assorted toxins).  This is not a product that is meant to \"taste like candy\", so if you are used to those designer whey powders that are full of sucralose and/or other artificial toxins and ridiculous flavors like  \"Super Duper Berry Cookie Crunch\", then you will find this product to be very disappointing.<br /><br />This product has very low solubility in water or milk, but mixes better with any freshly squeezed (non-factory-processed juices).  Fresh squeezed juice will generally have pith, fiber, etc. left in it that adds to its viscosity and greatly lowers the rate of dissolution (how long it takes for the hemp to become \\'unmixed\\' and sink to the bottom of the glass).  Essentially, the thicker the solvent, the less that the hemp will settle.  Additionally, having the juice at room temperature will further increase the solubility.<br /><br />I might also suggest a shaker/bottle combination of some type, as opposed to an open glass stirred with a spoon.  I use a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018G4ZEW\">BlenderBottle 28-Ounce with BlenderBall, Blue</a> myself.<br /><br />If you want a cheaper way to mix up milled hemp, please note that the above rules are applicable to canned tomato juice, since it is viscous, and stores well at room temperature (and is dirt cheap).

I\\'ve found using a wide mouthed nalgene bottle is the best way to prevent these types of accidents.<br /><br />In addition to the massive amounts of Vitamin B12, it has a good amount of Vitamin C (500mg), Niacin (10mg), Vitamin B6 (2.5mg), Calcium (60mg), Magnesium (100mg), and Potassium (905mg).  It has almost every water soluble vitamin meaning that a lot of the excess that your body doesn\\'t utilize, will be flushed through your kidneys.  With that being said, drink a lot of liquid with this and don\\'t over use the product (company recommends no more than 3 a day) or the chance of getting kidney stones exists.<br /><br />It has a 317mg \"proprietary\" blend blend of L-Arginine, L-Taurine, Caffeine from guarana, Alpha-lipoic acid, Grape seed extract, Green tea leaf extract, Ginger root, and Ginseng root.  I don\\'t know how much each compound contributes to the 317mg but they do acknowledge that 100mg of it is caffeine (about the same as a cup of coffee).<br /><br />There are multiple flavors but I\\'m partial to Grape and Orange Soda.

These strips are real strips of dried chicken, not just processed \"meats\" as some companies may use.  This particular flavor became our household favorite due to the effect it has on our easliy excited black lab, Hayden.<br /><br />At first I thought the ingredients were just light flavoring, since all of the packages seem to contain the exact same looking treats.  But, the smell is very strong.  This flavor contains chamomile and lavender - which claims to calm your dog.  This claim is very true for our dog.  Only after a couple of nights, we noticed a considerable difference in behavior for Hayden.  Our dog usually gets wound up in the evening time and continually wants to play even right before we go to bed.  After giving Hayden six strips, which is the suggested amount for his body size, he became docile and even sleepy before our bed time.<br /><br />I usually don\\'t believe the statements that most products like this claim, but I can say we have noticed a big difference.  Granted the effect is short term and can\\'t be predicted for really young dogs or \"unfixed\" dogs (for comparison our dog Hayden weighs 85 lbs, is 6 years old, and has been fixed).<br /><br />These are the draw backs though.  1) This is an expensive way to treat large dogs EVERY DAY, so maybe not realistic for everyone.  2) The effects may only last a few hours, so overly exciteable dogs may be able to \"battle through\" the effects.  3) Flavor is very strong and very odd (lavender?) some pickier dogs could turn their noses up to the smell and flavor of these treats.<br /><br />Just a note - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014IUZZ2\">Dogswell Happy Heart Chicken Breast, Flax Seed & Taurine, 3-Count 16-Ounce Bags</a> seems to have the opposite effect on our dog.

It's not just the bag that's changed: This stuff tastes like little more than brown water. YUCK!<br /><br />Original review (no longer applicable) follows:<br /><br />I originally bought Henry's Blend a few years back because it had a cat on it. They've since removed the cat, which is a shame because suckers for cat-promotions on coffee would totally pass this up as just another coffee.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm rather picky about my coffees. Previous to Henry's Blend I'd only truly enjoy something from our local bean roasters. I loathe Starbucks (tastes burnt to me), the other common brands all end up tasting watery and bland, but Henry's blend is just right - somewhere in the middle. It isn't too strong, it isn't too mild, and it has that stink that my mom calls the 'cat pee smell' (ironically) but not in a really intense way. More like mellow cat pee smelling.<br /><br />Anyway, I've tried others in the past few years but not one has had the right balance, and so back to Henry's blend I go.

       "  'text': 'We select the best quality foods we can afford and this includes coconut.  This review is a comparison between the Bob\\'s Red Mill and Tropical Traditions finely shredded coconut which I have been buying on their website - for some reason Amazon carries many of their products but not their coconut.<br /><br />Here is my comparison.<br /><br />Freshness- This item arrived with an expiration date of 3/2013, which is eleven months from delivery.  I wish I knew what the exp date was on the TT brand - but it lasted me well over a year on my shelf and I believe that since they harvest the Coconut (they are primarily a coconut products company) it may have been fresher.<br /><br />Price- I buy the Tropical Traditions in the plastic 3.5 gallon pail, which I buy online when it is half price at $17.50, which costs about $5 a lb.<br /><br />I decided to compare it to Bob\\'s Red Mill which I researched and felt was probably the highest quality on Amazon, so I got it with the Subscribe n Save, so I saved a little more.  Without the Subscribe n Save, Bob\\'s Mill has free shipping and currently comes to $4.38 a lb. I think Bob\\'s Mill is priced well for what you are getting.<br /><br />Shred size- is very close - but the Bob\\'s Red Mill is slightly larger.  I felt that the Tropical traditions was just a little too small for my taste.  It \"disappeared\" in my cooking and oatmeal and I never got to enjoy the crunch or the chew of it, only able to enjoy the flavor and smell.<br /><br />Dryness- both were equally dry and felt very similar.<br /><br />Aroma- the Tropical Traditions won hands down here.  The Bob\\'s Mills smelled fresh enough, just a very mild slightly toasted smell.  But the Tropical traditions has a much stronger sweet coconut smell (it is NOT a sweetened coconut product) which I find very appealing.  And this is after sitting on my shelf for over a year! It was not rancid at all. Since both of these items are shredded finely, and as I said, I do not \"feel\" the coconut in my food, I\\'ll probably go back to the Tropical Traditions line since that is what I am left to enjoy - the smell.<br /><br />Packaging-  I like that Bob\\'s Mill is conveniently packaged in 4 backs so you can freeze three for later.  The Tropical Traditions comes in a plastic pail that is very very hard to open.  And then you really don\\'t want to keep opening it.  Plus it does not fit in the freezer or fridge.  So the pail is a waste in my opinion.  I use mine for other things.<br /><br />I rate both products as 5 star items. Tropical Traditions wins if money and packaging are not an issue.  If they are then Bob\\'s Mill wins handily.<br /><br />We eat a lot of coconut, I use it in my cooking and we eat it for breakfast.  We eat it at least 3 to 4 times a week in our oatmeal mixed in with organic flax seed, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036Q6DSS\">Flax USA 100% Natural Organic Flax Cold Milled Ground Golden Flax Seed, 40-Ounce Packages</a> home frozen blue berries (store bought have high pesticides) and maple syrup.  What a wonderful way to eat healthy!!! I find that adding coconut adds just enough protein, 1 gram, that I am able to last all the way through till lunch without getting that sudden hunger I get an hour or two earlier without the coconut.'},\n",

This is my favorite vegetable soup, and I pretty much judge all others against it. Unfortunately, it has become increasingly difficult to find this product in my area. In fact, I can't find it at all. It was refreshing to stumble across it here on Amazon. I had not previously purchased more than one bag at a time when I wanted it. But after ordering it in bulk, I found a few other uses for it.<br /><br />Normal Use- This soup is great just by itself. Add water and you are good to go. But it is best if you add your own touch to it. I suppose each family has their own way of using it. I like to add stew meat (as per the instructions), and also a little extra carrot, celery, potatoes that I have on hand. You could pretty much add any vegetable, or even some canned tomato product to make it just how you like it. It's an awesome launch pad for perfect vegetable beef soup.<br /><br />Camping- It is a great camping food to take along. Take along some frozen stew meat, a carrot, a potato, etc. Brown the meat in a dutch oven over some coals, throw in the sliced vegetables and let it simmer for an hour. Your friends will be amazed wondering how you made such a great soup without a bunch of vegetables, and spices. It's super easy and fills you up with some tasty warm nutritious food on chilly nights.<br /><br />Prepping/Food Storage- This is a shelf stable food that lasts a very long time just sitting in the pantry. It is also easy to use by just adding water. Perfect for emergencies, or times when you may be unable to get to the store. If you can simmer water, you can have a satisfying meal for the whole family with this stuff.<br /><br />Potlucks- I hate those times when at the last minute I remember I have a potluck to do at work the following day. No problem. Get the large crockpot out of the cupboard. Cook it however you like it that night, then store in the fridge. Throw it in the crock pot the next day an hour or so before the time. Just add some paper bowls, bag of oyster shaped crackers, and plastic spoons and you'll be bringing home an empty crockpot.<br /><br />This really is a very versatile great tasting soup. Perfect item to have on hand!!!\"},\n",

Each time I\\'d take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I\\'d stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x\\'s a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I\\'ve been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a \"good\" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn\\'t believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn\\'t sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki\\'s tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don\\'t even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I\\'d be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it\\'s the same price as that store bought \"stuff\", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it\\'s real chicken, and sweet potatoes! (A lot of other good for her stuff!)<br /><br />I\\'m sold on Wellness (so is Miki~she loves it!)

As soon as the first kernel pops, put the lid on crooked to let the steam escape.<br /><br />Note: If your popcorn rises too high and is close to touching the bottom of the lid (use a clear lid) then remove the lid. Do not let the popcorn touch the moisture that accumulates on the bottom of the lid. It will ruin all those pieces.<br /><br />When finished popping (about 1 second in between pops), pour popcorn into a large bowl and place the empty pot back on the burner (now turned off).<br /><br />Add 1 TBS of unsalted butter (cut into small squares) into the pot you just cooked your popcorn in. Hold the pot and angle it so that the butter just stays on one side of the pot. If there are any remaining bits of popcorn in the pot, use your butter knife to knock them down into the melted butter. These are great little nuggets of joy while eating the popcorn!<br /><br />Slowly pour half of the butter over the popcorn in a circular fashion, starting at the center and working your way outward to the edge of the bowl. You want to pour a little more butter around the center and less around the edges, since the center of the bowl is the deepest. Sprinkle salt (1/2 the amount you would use) over the top. Use your butter knife and your opposite hand together to lightly toss the popcorn.<br /><br />Note: It is important to salt your popcorn after you pour the butter and before tossing, because the salt will stick better to the popcorn.<br /><br />Pour the other half of the melted butter over the popcorn. Sprinkle the other half of salt over your popcorn.  Lightly toss again.  Taste it.  Add salt if necessary.  Eat right away.<br /><br />Note: If you like your popcorn more buttery and/or oily, add 1/2 to 1 TBS of each to the recipe.\"},\n",

I would like it to satisfy more but what do you do to a shake to allow it to taste great, satisfy you even more, and not totally blow the overall appeal?<br /><br />Having spent many months drinking shakes as meal replacements (under doctor\\'s care), I can say that these completely blow the taste of the other shakes out of the water. There is a taste that I always equate to vitamins in them but that\\'s the added protein. Try drinking a protein powder and you\\'ll see what I mean. It has a very high amount of protein for such a small serving, this alone makes it worth drinking no matter your size.

You can actually taste Hazelnut in Community Coffee.  It's a bit bolder, but I like a good cup of coffee where you can actually taste the coffee (yeah).  I do not buy or search for Maxwell House any longer, nor do I enjoy Folgers or any of the much more expensive brands as none of them compare to the rich flavor of Community Hazelnut Coffee.

Growing up, we always had from one to three dogs.  After leaving home, I\\'ve had two sets of dogs.  My first set of dogs were healthy until their 16th year.

So much of their hair turned white that by the time they were three, they both looked like senior citizens - especially their faces.  I have hundreds of photos to prove this.  They drink excessive amounts of water and I have a hard time keeping their weight down.

It has an orange spice taste up front like the only flavored tea around when I was a kid, didn't like it then, don't like it now.  Then it finishes with a Stevia after taste!  Yuck.  I like my teas plain and would prefer to add my own sweetener if I feel it's needed.  This is a miss in my book and it's not surprising when the ingredients list 'natural orange flavor' before 'natural blueberry flavor' in the line up.  Why not something more natural like actual blueberry? Right? Silly me. It doesn't taste like a berry of any kind by my standards. So, if berry and green tea are the taste you're looking for AND you like the multifaceted herbal taste of Yogi brand teas then try their Goji Berry instead, it's wonderful w/ no weird sweetener after taste and no orange spice! Goji Berry is 5 stars in my book!\"},\n",

Although I prefer a light/medium roast, this might be a little too light and mild, even for my tastes.  If you prefer a very light roast, then this would be perfect for you.  It is otherwise smooth and seems like low acidity (my stomach isn't upset by it or anything) which are both great pluses.  Since I prefer my coffee a little darker than this, I will probably just add an extra scoop of coffee to the pot to get it up to my taste preference.<br /><br />I wish Coffee Bean Direct made a darker roasted fair trade coffee, b/c the price sure is right!

       "  'text': 'I don\\'t know why this is not known to everyone, everywhere, but cats should eat a grain free, wet food diet. They cannot digest or get any nutrition from grains, so there is no reason for grains to be in cat food, yet to save money, they put it in. Also, cats naturally have a very low thirst drive, and with the correct diet, they will hardly ever drink water. If they are on a dry kibble diet, they will have to drink to get their water, and with the low thirst drive that is natural, a lot of cats don\\'t get anywhere NEAR the amount of water they need. Cats on a dry food diet are likely to have kidney problems or urinary tract problems that could be prevented just by changing to a wet food diet. This is so important, and I urge everyone who loves their cat to get them off the dry food, and over a couple weeks, switch them to a grain free, wet food diet. Sorry to be preachy, but the word needs to be spread!<br /><br />This Weruva food is a big hit with my kitty, and it is a proper grain free wet food that makes sure he is getting the water he is supposed to get. Yes, it is canned in Thailand, but it is in an all human grade food facility. I would be much happier if it was all done in the US, but it has been reviewed by reputable sources and scored well. The other bonus, at least with the chicken flavors, is that they smell good! No stinky cat food smell, but in fact smells like something you might want a bite of. The cashier at the pet store I used to get this food from said he had eaten it, and it was good! Of course, it is also important to give them a variety, so I give him some of the \"fishy\" ones too, but the chicken smells great. I would recommend this food, but whether you feed this one or another one, please feed a grain free wet food diet to your cats!'},\n",

Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity.

More bland, and more like a sweet pile of mush than any distinct maple or brown sugar flavor.

I have always preferred my oatmeal with milk, so that's how I prepped it.

I don't know if they're using different oats or what, but even using less milk and cooking it full-time, my oatmeal was still a bit soupy. Letting it set had little effect, so I eventually gave up and just ate it.

Even then, it is just of hint of chocolate not a strong chocolate flavor.  As the tea sits longer, the mint and tea flavors tend to overwhelm the chocolate so there is just the barest hint left.

I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.

I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.  I'm planning on trying the parmesan and garlic next.\"},\n",

There are quite a few juices listed in the ingredients, including some not-so-common ones (acerola for instance), but I'm guessing the quantities were trace-like at best. Nope, what you get here is carbonated apple juice with maybe a hint of the berries' tartness...any watermelon flavor is lost somewhere in the mix, which isn't particularly surprising. Frankly, the effervescence is more pleasing than the actual taste.<br /><br />It's not really bad, I'd drink it again, but there are healthier things out there that you could be drinking. It might not have sugar added, but the sugar that's naturally in the juice is more than enough. All-natural doesn't always translate to good-for-you, which is something that seems to go over the head of some individuals. It might be better than soft drinks, but there really isn't much nutrition to be found here.

Our two cats have been living on various \"high end\" dry cat foods for some time now (e.g., the \"Before Grain\" foods in chicken, tuna and salmon versions, and some fancy pantsy \"Duck a l\\'orange\" stuff from our local pet shop).  They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn\\'t seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they\\'ve grown to love.<br /><br />However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth.  It doesn\\'t have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a \"treat\" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the broth).<br /><br />But I\\'m not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don\\'t want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash -- I\\'m concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet. Seeing \"Made in Thailand\" emblazoned on the box made me immediately wonder whether this stuff might include ingredients banned in the US or could otherwise be manufactured without adequate regulation of methods and materials.  The Chinese pet food fiasco certainly came to mind.<br /><br />The discussions of other reviewers about the menadione used in this product confirms my concern.  I\\'m also left to wonder about the source of the fish and seafood in these cans -- is it farm raised in Thailand and if so under what conditions; is it wild fish that may be subject to overfishing and at the very least ought to be feeding hungry humanity rather than going down my cats\\' gullets; what about mercury and other contaminants in the food?<br /><br />Bottom line: my cats seem to love the stuff, but I\\'m not sure that will be sufficient to convince me to buy it again.'},\n",

For many years, we still percolated coffee...with most big-name brands of pre-ground coffee, you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it, but again, your tastes may vary.<br /><br />With my Keurig, my favorite coffee was Paul Neumans Extra Bold....because it didn\\'t seem Extra Bold.

Now, in my fifties, I tend to use them as my family has for generations: as an accompaniment for different dishes, as well as a mixer in certain other recipes.<br /><br />I didn't discover Frank's until around 25 years ago, as it doesn't come from the South.  However, I fell in love with it on first taste, and it has been in my kitchens ever since.  The unique ingredient that Frank's has is its infusion of garlic.  Not strong, but there.  The motto that this sauce adds flavor and not just heat is quite accurate.  I like spice in and on foods, but my measure for hot sauces is whether I can put some in a spoon and taste it without having to rush for a glass of cold milk.  Frank's passes this test; in fact, I've been known to take a nip when I'm just wanting a taste in my mouth!  It seems to be much better distributed in this part of the world than when it was done by Durkee's.  Hard to say whether it's my favorite, as they are all different.  I don't buy the tiny bottle or the huge one; the in-between is the right size for mine.  Just great stuff, and not overpriced like some others.\"},\n",

Even if he seemed to like the taste-- he made himself gag trying to get it out of his mouth and didn't want to swallow it. He seems to be sensitive to texture anyway, so maybe this just wasn't a good choice for him. He does like the Earth's Best fruit variety pack, but any of the fruits mixed with grains were a definite no go. The nanny and I both even tried thinning down the mixture with breast milk or formula, and he still did not like it and spit it out. I would recommend trying one jar before you buy the variety pack because I had to give these away.\"},\n",

It's not too overdone or underdone on the spice, it's a perfect little cookie.  Not to mention they are 26 calories each, and ingredient that are pronounceable, this makes for an excellent little treat with coffee, tea, or vanilla ice cream.

I saw this as a relatively cheap alternative to the raw diet I had them on which was great quality but took a lot of work to prepare (the pre-prepped one was even more expensive).<br /><br />For anyone who's done research on dog food, we all know that raw is the best diet we can feed our dogs, it gives them nutritional content, probiotics, moisture, all the things that they need to thrive. For anyone who's been on high grade dog foods, you also know that you can switch foods for your dogs without any concern about stomach/bowel issues. Be forewarned, this is NOT the case with Sojos.<br /><br />I had been feeding my dogs Nature's Variety Instinct Raw (switching as I please between the protein varieties) and Orijen (I switch between all the Orijen flavors). I normally did half in the morning and half a night using one type of food for each feeding. I figure, why not throw Sojos into the mix to give them some variety and save some money. That's when problems instantly began.<br /><br />They liked the food at first, it was new and exciting and they gobbled it up, then when it made its way through their system, they had very runny stool. It was still not too bad and I could understand minor transition time, but by the end of day 1 it was full on diarrhea. I spent an entire weekend (and then some) nursing them back to health, fully on Nature's Variety Instinct mixed with organic pumpkin to settle the stomach. But I spent the majority of my time walking them, and being heartbroken to see bloody stool (knowing I had caused it by carelessly choosing a poor quality dog food product).<br /><br />I know some will argue, 'you didn't transition your dogs,' but honestly, when you stay in the high quality spectrum of dog foods you don't have to. Especially when you know your dogs don't have problems. I've fed them Blue, Candiae, Nature's Variety, Great Life, Orijen, Acana, Nature's Variety Instinct Raw, Earthborn, EVO. And that's not even adding to the mix the versions of those foods that have grain and grain free varieties. I've NEVER had a problem with switching them back and forth.<br /><br />So, this is certainly a better option that Science Diet, but it isn't for everyone, and it certainly isn't for people who want to feed their dogs the best stuff they can. This is NOT a replacement for a raw diet. Please take caution before switching.<br /><br />(Also I read a reviewer who cooks their proteins before feeding it to their dog, how does that not completely defeat the purpose in feeding raw in the first place?)\"},\n",

I did get 3 dented cans out of the 12- one was a mild ding, one was fair, and one was such that if I'd been picking it out at the grocery store, I would have looked for a different one- I just ate that one first.  Oddly, they were cans that came from the MIDDLE of the case- so something that happened at the manufacturer- NOT Amazon.  The cardboard tray was unscathed.  ConAgra needs to  do a quality control check on their can dinging area.<br /><br />Anyway, the flavor is pretty good. The first bite wasn't impressive, but since I'm on a fixed income, I only throw away stuff that is about to make me hurl, so I kept eating it.  It got better, and I am glad I got the product.  There were 7 ravioli in the whole can. That is a bit skimpy, but since it was going to be the only thing I had, I ate the whole can and was quite satisfied.  The sauce is much more flavorful than the Chef-Boyardee regular beef ravioli that I had as a kid, and tastes more Italian.<br /><br />The WHOLE can has 480 calories, 10 gms of fat, 78 gms of carbs, and 18 gms of protein.  There are also 10 gms of fiber in the whole can.  The serving size says that  the can is about 2 servings.  Hmm.... maybe for a young kid, or if there was a good salad, and fruit on the side, but I have too much pain to make full meals.  I have to make do.  There are 1 1/2 cups of vegetables per can- so that's good.<br /><br />No preservatives or MSG.  Unfortunately, it probably contains GMO sources of soy and wheat.<br /><br />I originally got these to have on hand for power outages, as I have a gas oven and could heat this up.  The expiration date is for 2 years from now, so that's good.

So thanks to China we have a great product with a much cheaper price point then we would normally have to pay for.  We are one world people, and if another country can make a quality product with a lighter impact on the environment then we can, I am happy to share whatever the profits are with them.  Sure they made many mistakes industrializing, and I am sure they will make more... just as we will.  However, they are very sensitive to maintaining quality at a good price point, and I have more faith in chicken coming from China then I do from the US... sad to say but true.<br /><br />So back to the review.  While the quality and look of the product is great looking, the smell indicates that the flavors are probably stronger then just regular chicken (think of beef jerky).  If your dog has a very sensitive tummy I would buy a small pack first and make certain that it digests easily.  As for my dog, a Golden Retriever, he would likely gobble the whole bag if he could, and not think twice about doing it again the next day.\"},\n",

Pill Pockets are by far the easiest method.<br /><br />Most of our animals have considered Pill Pockets as \"treats\" and readily eaten them.  Our current feline gets three pockets in the morning and three in the evening, so we go through a lot.<br /><br />One suggestion:  if your smaller pet needs to take many meds, buy the pockets designed for capsuls for dogs.  Product pricing seems to be related to the number of \"doses\", rather than the weight.  I believe the small package for cats is 1.6 oz and costs only a few $ less than this 6.6 oz package. If you go through the pockets like we do, the savings are substantial.  We simply tear off a piece of the larger pocket and wrap it around the pill.  It takes 15 seconds.<br /><br />Another suggestion is to get a selection of flavors.  Our cat goes through periods where certain flavors are unacceptable, so it is good to alternate and have backups.<br /><br />If you are really desperate, you can always use human meat baby food.  We haven\\'t seen a cat yet that would\\'t take that.<br /><br />Summary:  A much better way to give your pet meds than a pill shooter.'},\n",

Like others say, they are small, firm, and really flavorful. They take more time and water to cook than most other kinds of lentils I've used due to their firmness, but retain their shape really well.  They are also chewy, not mushy, and the flavor is kind of nutty. You can do anything you want with them - make curry, soup, salad, mix them with rice or quinoa or chopped veggies, season them any way you like. I love lentils in general, other faves are red lentils (sweet and mushy, make great soup) and black lentils (tiny and round, and a great alternative to black beans) which I can get at local health food stores, but these are truly top shelf, and I've never seen them in stores.

The Friskie's, for being a cheap brand, actually did a pretty good job of improving this condition, since she refuses to let me brush. However, they took this food off the market. The remaining 2 options are this food and Hill's.<br /><br />Finding this online with the free shipping and the cheaper price sealed the deal for me, as they don't usually have it in the store, and her oral condition was deteriorating again. I had been feeding her a hairball and healthy weight formula just because it was what my other cat ate in the meantime, and was happy to have a new dental food.<br /><br />After slowly switching her over, I realized this food really isn't as good as it seems. It mildly improved her teeth, but her breath is still awful and I can see tartar (compared to the improvement I saw from the Friskie's). She now has started coughing up hairballs almost every other day, and she is gaining weight rapidly, even though I feed her less than a cup a day. She also acts hungry all the time. I checked the amount of fat in this food, and it is almost double the healthy weight formula. So I can feed her a normal amount and she will continue to get fatter (been on it for about 3 months, and has gained at least 2 pounds) or I can starve her so she maintains a normal weight. I recommend checking the nutrition or even trying the Hill's if your cat has severe gum/tooth disease, weight issues, or hairball problems. The other reviewers gave it favorable ratings, however, so maybe if your cat has mild problems it will work for you.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'I was getting VERY worried, when I read some of the other reviews here.  Specifically, the \"One Star\" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.<br /><br />WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.<br /><br />Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.<br />But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it\\'s deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we\\'re all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of \"United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers\"....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the \"Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum\"! : )<br /><br />I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a \"Potato Chip Diet\".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I\\'d like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I\\'ve taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn\\'t like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!<br /><br />Flavoured potato PERFECTION!'},\n",

My box has an October 25, 2012 best-used-by date -- about three months at least.<br /><br />Of the six packets in the box, four cookies were whole and two were broken.  The cookie is soft but very dry which was interesting because the chocolate chunks melt on contact with your fingers.  The chocolate was soft, the almond pieces were firm, and the whole oat grains were slightly tough.  My first impression was dry with a sawdust-like texture.<br /><br />Overall, I would suggest having this treat with something liquid - coffee, hot tea, milk.  It actually does look like a fresh home baked cookie so it is attractive to the eye.  The chocolate chunks and almond pieces were large enough to be easily identifiable and the cookie was not overly sweet, just enough to satisfy a craving for something to treat yourself with.

I love garlic and lots of it. Raw, baked, paste, confit in oil...you name it. This, sadly, wasn't rice/quinoa/garlic as I know it.<br /><br />-First off, the blend doesn't quite look like it shows on the package, of course. The colours are more drab and khaki-hued. Yummy! There's also not nearly as much quinoa in the package as there appears to be in the picture. I normally expect packaging to be misleading but in the picture it looks like roughly 60/40 or 50/50 rice:quinoa. In real life, it's more like 90/10...MAYBE 75/25 if you want to be generous.<br /><br />-Secondly, whatever Seeds of Change did to the 'garlic' in this stuff shouldn't happen to a hardened criminal! The smell is unbearable. Pungent, cloying and slightly sour. Very unappetising. Mixed with the drab colour of the final cooked product, it doesn't really put it's best foot forward if you know what I mean. Just by the smell and look alone, I was already losing my appetite, and I was *quite* hungry when we prepared this. Great if you're on a diet, I suppose...<br /><br />-It tastes as bad as it smells, but fortunately not as cloying. There is no depth of flavour, so the taste doesn't really linger long on the tongue. This is actually in the 'Pro' column since the taste is dreadful. Flat, cardboard-like, faintly acrid, and the only thing vaguely resembling garlic is the aftertaste and smell it leaves on your breath. When there's more aftertaste than initial taste, that's never a good sign. It's as if they took immature garlic, slightly burnt it, dehydrated it, pulverised it to a fine powder and threw it in the package as an afterthought. VERY disappointing as I've had other Seeds of Change products and liked them quite a bit!<br /><br />-I *will* say that they did a great job on the texture. The texture was very nice, just the right kind of 'al dente' that I like. This, regrettably, put all the other defects of the product into sharper relief. If only it didn't taste terrible!<br /><br />-You might be able to doctor this product up with some sort of sauce or extra seasonings but 1)that could be risking making it worse and 2)why would you waste the time and effort.

I'll still use this on my brisket. Can't go wrong with perfection. Brisket recipe: Take a brisket with a nice slab of fat over it (you can take it off later) not too thick not too thin (you need this for keeping the meat moist and tender). Pour 1-2 bottles over the brisket (depends on the size) in a deep roasting pan (I use an enamel pan)deep enough to be able to put a piece of foil over the top without touching the brisket. Seal the edges of the foil around the pan to make a tent. Put in the oven at 250-275 degrees for a few hours. ( Frozen brisket is even better) if frozen, then cook longer (at least double time) You can check it from time to time. Watch out for the steam when you roll back a corner/side. Check with a fork to see if it starts to flake, taste it, you'll know if it's done. This will be the flaky, moistest brisket you ever ate. (skim off the fat and throw away).

I've bought it two times and I've dropped off 20 pounds just doing a shake diet.<br /><br />Do one scoop [do two scoops thirty minutes to an hour before going exercising]<br />Do this every hour [you can have two solid meals but don't go over 250 calories, and no drinking shakes or eating after 8]<br />Use water instead of milk<br /><br />That's how I did it and I lost a lot. I would have gave it five stars but the price went up. When I first bought this product, I paid twenty-five dollars and some cents. Now it's almost thirty dollars. They need to go back down on the product. But if you're not doing a shake diet and just use this for workouts and stuff, I don't know how it's going to work you. Well I do know when you workout, you going to feel it like with any other workout but the next day, you will not be sore. That's why I love it. When I'm exercising, I feel the burn, the pain.

My first shipment was scheduled to arrive on June 6, but to my surprise, arrived June 4. I opened up the box, and was pleased first off to see that the pods were packed into bags of 8, in order to keep them fresh longer. This was a plus, because no one wants stale coffee that has lost it's 'umph', and I had wondered how I was going to manage to keep all of the pods fresh until I used them up. The exposed filter had concerned me, but with the amount of coffee I drink, they won't have time to go stale opening one of the small bags at a time.<br /><br />My curiosity about the coffee couldn't stand any more, so I cut open one of the bags. The smell was amazing! Before I had even brewed my first cup, I knew this was going to be good. There was no 'burnt' smell to the coffee, just pleasant, rich aroma. Although I had already had my normal 4 cups for the day, I just had to have a cup immediately to see if it tasted as good as it smelled. I was not disappointed. In fact, I was quite impressed.<br /><br />The coffee is rich and bold without the bitterness of many dark roasts. It's very smooth and just begs you to drink more. I'm not an expert, so I won't try to rate the acidity, flavor notes, or anything like that, but I am a life long coffee lover and 4 cup a day drinker, so for me to say that this coffee is impressive means that at least I have some experience with different tasting coffees and it has passed my personal tests. If you prefer a 'weaker' cup of coffee, you can even brew twice from the same pod into a larger travel mug. It's good either way, I just personally prefer strong coffee.<br /><br />I highly recommend this coffee for it's flavor, it's value, and on top of those, the fact that it's organic and produces less waste than typical K-cups. If you are looking for a smooth, dark roast coffee, by all means give the San Francisco Bay Rainforest Blend a try. You'll be glad you did.\"},\n",

You can take them anywhere, keep them in your desk at work or in your purse!<br /><br />The only complaint I have about these is that I wish there were versions with lower sodium.  To me, as someone who loves a good salty snack, but knows that too much salt is not good and tries to avoid it, these taste too salty.  And 300+ mg of sodium per strip seems high.<br /><br />But in the end I am overlooking the sodium and am purchasing these in bulk now!  I just bought the Thai Peanut flavor because I love spicy foods, and I love Thai food!  I'll update this review with my thoughts on this flavor after I receive them.<br /><br />UPDATE: I received the Thai Peanut flavor and LOVE them!  They have a great chewy texture, good flavor, and a good amount of spice.  All for only 74 calories each, but 10g protein!  I definitely recommend these!\"},\n",

I do not like cleaning out the kitty litter box. UNTIL I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT.<br />I have to admit that I do not use it \"straight\" but am currently mixing it half and half with Swheat. But I am working to the end of using only the pearls. The kids are currently getting used to the feel.<br />BUT ALREADY there is NO ODOR. (Well there is just after they poop, but no one can change that.)<br />But as soon as the waste is buried, the smell evaporates and is gone. I have never seen anything like it.<br />The two big guys share a box and the two small ones have their own. I just cleaned them out. (Trash goes out today.) The big box, which I normally hate to do, was odorless. I scooped out the poop. I scooped out the clumps of urine, including all the small break away clumps and was done. No more rumaging around getting out the odds and ends that had gotten wet and needed to be gotten rid of to get rid of odor. Done in 5 minutes flat.<br />On to the little box. Took the disposable plastic spoon and got out the clumps of poop. Got out the few urine clumps and was done. Two minutes flat.<br />Got the hand held battery driven sweeper and got the dust that hit the floor and was done. It took me  10 minutes to do a job that used to take 30 minutes.<br />And the best part was that it was just a job. It was not a gross out production. I washed my hands with disinfectant soap and came to write the review.<br />Best Kitty Litter Stuff I have ever used. I put it on for monthly delivery and am pleased with the whole deal, cost and all. It arrives at my front door once a month with no extra shopping and cleans up like a breeze. No smell. I certianly recommend it to all kitter people.<br /><br />After using this for almost 6 weeks, I have to amend my first review of this product. Yes, it is amazing and keeps the smell down, but it was not as great as I thought. Initially, I had used it for my two kittens. Their poops are small and they urinate and leave small little domes and both were well covered. Then, I began using this Pure Product (not mixed with any other product with all four of my cats, two of whom are regular cats, one is 16 pounds and one is 11. One is female and one is male. Now males are nice things, but when it comes to male cats, urinating IS a BIG deal. My cat seems to save it up for a one or two times a day process, so when he goes, it is a flood. And Male urine is more pungent than female cat urine. There is too much of it to make the usual nice compact valcano shaped product that the kittens leave. He simly wets down one whole end of the box and it smells to bad to mix with the other and is also too saturated to do so, so one twentieth of the entire box has to be thrown out after Mr. T. uses the box. That automatically means the box cannot be used by him more than 20 times. Then, in comes the female. She does leave a compact volcano shaped urine package, but the poop is huge and has to go. If nobody bothered to cover anything, I could scoop out the poop and lift out the urine and be done. Worked with the kittens. But no, with the addition of two humongo cats, the box is throughly stired and within 4 or 5 days, at the MOST, the whole 7 pounds is used up and gone. I cannot afford 7 pounds of the litter 6 or 7 times a month.<br /><br />Also, with the addition of the two big cats, litter bits were everywhere and walking on that litter is like walking on sand in your house. It tears up the tile and gets in the carpet. Ugh. I spent a lot of time cleaning the laundry room where the boxes are when I used this litter.<br /><br />So overall, I have moved this from a 5 star to a 3 star item. I can\\'t afford it, with bigs cats added, it does smell, and I cannot afford enough to cover 4 cats for the month. So, I have moved it down to three stars. Sorry about that, but REALITY HIT ME!'},\n",

I then checked the packaging which I had saved from the original container and there was NO date next to \"Best if used by\". Now, I am going to a Christmas party to which I was going to bring homemade bread, and its too late to make a fourth loaf. Please, check for dates when receiving this product. I am very disappointed.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Z7VYXW\">Saf Instant Yeast, 1-Pound Pouches (Pack of 4)</a>'},\n",

Many of the ingredients listed contain VERY high levels of MSG (free glutamate), and are included BECAUSE they contain MSG.<br />4. Both Disodium Inosinate and Disodium Guanylate are also included, which are pretty expensive to add, and are only added because they enhance the effects of MSG--they do nothing else.

It has found a home in the realm of Asian cuisine, the ginger man cookie would be lost without it and nothing says \"adult soda\" like a glass of ginger ale.  And this is only the beginning of what you can do with ginger (root).  Yet it must be remembered that a little can go a long way.<br /><br />This brings us to this \"ginger snap\" cookie by \"Newman\\'s Own\".  In a word I would have to describe this cookie as \"awful\".  It is too gingery, to the point that my mouth feels like I just ate too much hot sauce once the cookie is chewed and swallowed, in other words bad after taste. The cookie has no balance in flavor; it is just straight up ginger, a sweet aspect would be nice. If I wanted to experience that much ginger I would just chew on ginger root. The cookie itself is as hard as a rock.  I was actually concerned I might chip my teeth when biting into this cookie and this is no hyperbole.  Not to mention that the back of almost every cookie in the bag were burnt.<br /><br />The bag itself is very small and the cost is rather high for what the product really is.  This cookie is also made with organic ingredients.  The one category of food marketing that fails to impress me is organic foods.

While the rice/quinoa blend is quite tasty, the product is overpriced given what bulk rice and quinoa cost. Personally, I don't shop organic so any premium for this attribute is something I don't value. What is valued is the speed of preparation. These pouches can be microwaved in 90 seconds. Just rip a small vent, place in the microwave and 90 seconds later, you have a meal. No water is needed.<br /><br />The taste is superior to rice alone in my personal opinion. There is a notable taste difference compared to other rice-dishes, so the added variety could be worth the price premium for individuals who don't have the time cook rice and quinoa conventionally.<br /><br />One of the touted benefits of Quinoa is the protein content.  Yet, this product only has 6 grams of protein for every 240 calorie serving.  This is a lower protein/calorie ratio than whole grain bread.  Protein has four calories per gram, which would mean that 240 calories of pure protein could yield 60 grams of protein.  Realistically, high protein foods would have four to six times as much protein as this product per calorie.<br /><br />If you are looking for a healthy, high carbohydrate snack or small meal, give the Seeds of Change quinoa/rice a shot. Longer term, you would be much better off making a similar dish using bulk incredients at a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />Pros<br />Fast preparation<br />Tasty<br />Potential health benefits<br /><br />Cons<br />LOW protein content<br />Expensive\"},\n",

Chile peppers are certainly there, but hot pepper fans will want to add more. Officially, this kit is for Rendang Curry with beef, but the back of the box states that chicken or lamb would be equally appropriate. I used beef, and made only half of the recipe, as I was the only one eating...the package says that the opened envelopes will keep for three days, so I froze the remainder for future use.  The full recipe calls for nearly two pounds of meat and no added vegetables; if you choose to add vegetables you will have enough curry to feed a small family, so I'd advise that.

Whether or not the Prima Taste is worth its price is a judgment call, but I probably wouldn't get it again, just because I like to make my own curry. But you can prepare a quick, easy and tasty meal with this product. Prima Taste offers several such sauce kits, and they may be worth a try as well.\"},\n",

Add 1 tsp of baking powder -> adds fluff (1 tsp for every cup of flour)<br /><br />2. If allergic to eggs -> use Ener-G egg replacement. Follow the directions. Add 1 tsp of olive oil (help with the texture since the egg fat isn't present)<br /><br />3. DO NOT OVER MIX! GO slow if you have to. Watch a video on knowing when the dough is elastic so you know when to stop. (One of the flours in this batch gets hard from over mixing - will update when I remember which one)<br /><br />4. Keep the 3 tbsp of oil (I used olive oil) Chebe calls for. If you replace with applesauce, it will add as a binder. Trust me, you do NOT want two binders in a recipe.<br /><br />5. Take your time rolling the dough to make it nice and tight. This keeps the Cinnamon mix in the middle.<br /><br />6. To heat up the rolls again, DO NOT USE THE MICROWAVE! Use a toaster oven or a nonstick pan with a cover. I personally use the pan and steam heat the rolls again.<br /><br />These tricks may not work for all. I will update when I learn more and feel free to post your own tricks.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'I\\'m not sure if it was because I received my product via Vine, but I noticed that the product description is for a pack of SIX bars, but my box was a FIVE pack (it\\'s even written on the front of the box).  It\\'s a regular retail package and looks just like the picture on Amazon, so I\\'m just hoping that mine isn\\'t indicative of what\\'s being sold here.  Still, it could be a fluke, so I\\'m not knocking off any stars for that, however, caveat emptor.<br /><br />No, my three-star rating is because these bars just weren\\'t very good granola bars.<br /><br />On the positive side, these bars are relatively low in calories (110), fat (3g), sodium (85mg) and sugar (7g), and have 4g of dietary fiber.  What I didn\\'t care for was the taste (or lack thereof).  I understand that chewy granola bars tend to be more \"airy,\" but this bar just isn\\'t as dense as other granola bars, so it doesn\\'t feel satisfying.  And, despite the dark chocolate, it had a soy/fiber taste that reminded me a bit of cardboard.  This is coming from someone who drinks regularly soy milk and needs to consume large amounts of fiber daily.  Plus, the dark chocolate taste wasn\\'t that strong, it was just sweet, making it a sweet, chewy, oaty mass that left me feeling like having another snack, defeating the purpose of this snack bar.  I suppose the best way to describe it to someone is, and pardon me for being cliche and vague, \"It\\'s only okay.\"<br /><br />Also, I hope the way my box of granola bars was shipped was due to the fact that I was getting it free on Vine and this will not be how it\\'ll be shipped to other customers.  My box was shipped in a large, padded envelope, so the box inside was completely smashed, as were most of the bars inside.  It looked like it had been sat on and folded a few times.  Horrible.  I\\'m usually pretty pleased with Amazon\\'s shipping, so this was a shock and disappointment.  I realize this isn\\'t an issue with the product itself, so I\\'m not deducting any stars for it, but I felt it bad enough to warrant a mention.<br /><br />I eat all sorts of granola, energy, and protein bars, and though I realize that this one is a \"diet\" snack, I\\'ve had others with more taste and felt more filling, but if you\\'re the type to reach for a candy bar when your stomach growls, this could be a healthier alternative.'},\n",

I initially settled on Newman\\'s Own Dark Roast as my \"go-to\" coffee, but I didn\\'t stop there.  I like to keep experimenting and looking for something new.  I happened to find Coffee People\\'s Organic Extra Bold blend and was blown away.  It has been my favorite ever since I first tried it.  Last week I saw a listing for a Colombian dark roast sold under the Wolfgang Puck name (it is processed and distributed by Van Houtte) and decided to give it try.  Here is my impression of it:<br /><br />After brewing a cup (I used the 7 1/2 oz. setting) the first thing that I noticed was that it didn\\'t have that freshly-brewed aroma that the Coffee People X-Bold does, however the taste was another story.  It hits your palate with medium acidity and a nice, sharp bite that gets your attention right away. The finish was surprising clean with a hint of spice (nutmeg or cinnamon?) and just a slight, lingering, pleasant bitterness.  I really like this coffee but I think that I will stick with Coffee People\\'s Extra Bold and this will be my back-up brand.  However, I will keep looking for something new.

I haven't had the authentic, from-Korea ramyun (yet!) but this is much better than any ramen or other instant noodle you'll find in any typical American super market.

It's really not that spicy, just enough to clear up your sinuses, and it's not a spicy-for-the-sake-of-it kind of spicy, it's really quite full of deep flavors. I prepare it as per the directions on the packaging except I reduce cook time by 25-30 seconds and, when they're done, I crack one or two eggs into the pot after I bring it off the burner. The residual heat in the pot is more than enough to cook the egg, you just have to remember to break up the yolk and stir the egg around the pot. It helps to thicken the soup as well, which means it tends to stick to the noodles much better.<br /><br />Overall, the noodles are quite delicious, and the best American-made noodle I've ever had.

The first night, I filled 3 gel capsules with the tincture and went to bed and felt NO EFFECTS WHATSOEVER!  If anything, I remembered less dreams than I usually do on any given night and had more disturbed sleep.  I had read another review about this herb requiring more of it to perhaps experience lucid dreaming... Emboldened by the fact that I wasn't allergic to it, I measured out 20ml and this time drank an over the counter sleep drink that contained melatonin with it and went to bed after 45 minutes... Nothing. Again. Waking up in the middle of the night over and over again with no dream recall which is LESS than my day to day.<br /><br />So, I figured that maybe it has a reverse tolerance...So the third night, I took 30ml on a mostly empty stomach...By now, the taste didn't bother me as I have been used to tinctures before and this is by far not the worst. I had noticed some muscle soreness the nights before and started to get some of this this night as well...Still, no dream recall; and this coming from someone who recalls a dream daily.  Some sleep disturbance but not tired because of it...So much for third time's the charm...<br /><br />I waited for a few days and figured one last go around; a fourth time...I had dreams that I recalled on the days without it in between the third time and the fourth time...I tried 30ml again and on mostly an empty stomach...Not only no dream recall but woke up earlier than I normally do...I don't feel overly tired from waking but certainly no dream recall, much less any lucid dreaming...<br /><br />This may work for some folks, but at price over $30, with no return policy and the bottle more than half gone, I am disappointed thoroughly.

       "  'text': \"We have had an ongoing gopher problem in our yard since we neighbor a large hillside. Our nicely landscaped yard and moist soil is a buffet for gophers.<br /><br />We have tried the following with a mediocre success rate:<br /><br />1) Ultrasonic repellants (battery or solar powered stakes) - This may keep them from creating a burrow under your yard, but it doesn't keep them from eating your grass at night. Waste of money.<br /><br />2) Castor oil pellets and spray (Sweeney's) - Seems to deter them if your grass is freshly sprayed. A hungry gopher will still find roots to eat and will still tear up your yard in the process. It also is an ongoing process to apply this stuff and doesn't make your yard smell to good. For the price and effort, not recommended.<br /><br />3) Smoke bombs (Giant Destroyer) - These work if you catch the gopher red-handed and quickly insert the smoke bomb in the active hole. Also, If you have a network of tunnels in your yard and find a main runway you may kill some gophers as well. The problem is that a gopher will instinctively 'plug up' the tunnel and return to it's burrow. However, I still keep these on hand in case the situation calls for it.<br /><br />4) Flooding - this may work in some cases you can drown the gopher or it will dig its way out and catch the end of your shovel. For a gopher invading your yard it will only slow it down and cause it to dig in other spots. Gophers design their tunnels in a way that their burrow is protected against flooding. You also make a big muddy mess in most cases.<br /><br />5) Rototiller - This is a sure way to evict gophers if you are starting from ground zero. be sure to keep a shovel handy since they will run for cover. This is good for new yards since it will break down any existing tunnel system. If you are planting sod be sure to lay chicken wire a few inches below the sod. Gophers love grass roots.<br /><br />Once you have an established landscape that is being compromised by gophers - the best thing to use is:<br /><br />6) TRAPS! -  If you dig up a gopher mound and find a tunnel, the gopher will instinctively 'plug up' the opening or push dirt out as it continues to dig up your yard. By placing this trap IN an active open tunnel you will catch the gopher as it pushes dirt out. This is the best solution I have found.<br />A few tips:<br />  a) Tie a string or wire to the trap and the other end to a stick or some sort of anchor. This way you can pull the gopher out since it will try to retreat when it's trapped.<br />  b) cover the hole with a bucket or box to block the light. Gophers are sensitive to light and it may choose to plug up the tunnel and not approach the trap.<br />  c) I have a low tolerance for dead rodents and choose to throw the trap away with the dead gopher. Considering the time and money I spend on my garden, $5 for a dead gopher is a small price to pay.<br /><br />We are currently enjoying a gopher free garden without poisons and smelly repellents. I highly recommend this or other similar wire traps.\"},\n",

He gets his dinner through this jug sometimes.<br /><br />I was nervous about purchasing it because of the reviews stating how the rubber \"rope\" was easily chopped, but I figured I might be able to replace it with a real rope if it breaks. To my surprise, the purple rope hasn\\'t broke and I had this toy for several months now. My dog has been chewing it with his molars, but not very often. Also he may not be as a strong chewer as the dogs from other reviews.<br /><br />When my dog first recieved this toy, he kept pawing at it and pushing it with his nose panting with exsaustion. It took about an hour until he almost got the one cup of kibble that was in it. Later he got used to it and now he has a strategy. He pushes the back of the bottle straight up. He can empty the bottle in about 10 minutes now.<br /><br />A major problem I have with this toy is that the rubber spikes and the rope gets pretty nasty. It picks up hair from the carpet and dry food crumbs from the kibble inside the bottle and builds up to a disgusting slimy gunk. It is extremely hard to get all the crap out between the spikes and the inner edges of the rope.<br /><br />Over all it is a good toy for my medium sized mutt.

Gluten-free mixes for the most part are horrible and this used to be exceptional not only in taste but in texture.<br /><br />To my great surprise and disappointment the ingredients have been reformulated. I recently reordered two cases of this mix; same packaging, etc. so no reason to suspect anything had changed.<br /><br />Well, as I was baking yesterday I noticed the \"new\" mix was a different color, in comparison to the \"old\" mix (I still had 3 older bags) and consistency when stirring was like mixing chalk powder in water.<br /><br />As the muffins were baking, the \"old\" batch mix was baking beautifully (nice golden brown) but in comparison the \"new\" batch mix did not appear to be baking (still pale white coloring after 20 minutes in the oven).<br /><br />So here\\'s the scoop, the bag is now 13.5 ounces versus what was 16 ounces. There was no disclosure on the bag stating this major change.  In addition, many of the key taste ingredients have been eliminated such as vanilla bean powder, cinnamon and nutmeg.  The base ingredient was brown rice flour but is now whole grain brown rice flour (pale bland flour).  Now I know why the \"new\" product is bland! The taste is now gritty and in essence unpalatable.<br /><br />Unfortunately I still have one unopened case but will not be able to return it; Amazon does not allow food product returns. I believe the manufacturer should have disclosed all of these changes clearly on the packaging thus allowing consumers (like me) the option of purchasing or not.  If I had known the mix was reformulated I never would have reordered. Base cost per bag including tax is $4.84.  But keep in mind that your cost is slightly higher because you must add oil, sugar and any other ingredient i.e. blueberries, nuts, etc. to make the \"finished\" product.<br /><br />My recommendation, do not buy this reformulated product.'},\n",

Each individual bottle is quite small and then the narrow neck is covered with some kind of wax or foil cover that has no easy means of getting in--and as the top portion is so narrow that the only way to do it was to cut into it with a sharp blade, it would have been easy to cut myself. I finally was able to cut off tiny bits of the overwrap (which seemed to be a bit sick possibly with some minor oil leakage--perhaps from one of the other bottles) after about 10 minutes only to be confronted with a teeny, tiny cork jammed well into a narrow neck of the bottle with no gripper area or way to get the cork out. I tried two different wine openers with one almost pushing the cork all the way in...

They are, as another reviewer noted, somewhat chalky.  You will want to have something to drink with these -- preferably water.  The flavor of these is pretty good, though.  Barbecue is the best of the various flavors these come in.  One problem with the soy nuts is that the manufacturer hasn\\'t seemed to figure out how to get the flavoring powder to stick well to the soy nuts.  Because of this, a lot of the powder falls off, and the flavor has to be reasonably strong for you to taste it.  Barbecue makes it pretty well, whereas some of the other available flavors don\\'t.<br /><br />Once again, these aren\\'t bad.  I don\\'t know if I\\'ll buy them again, though.

(And if you\\'re considering this food good enough for your own consumption, please note that the ingredient is also potentially toxic to human organs).<br /><br />Here\\'s the list of ingredients, from the manufacturer\\'s website:<br /><br />Fish broth<br />Tuna fillets<br />Yellow fin whole loin tuna/red snapper/shrimp/sole<br />Soy bean oil<br />Trialcium phosphate<br />Guar gum<br />Calcium sulfate<br />Carrageenan<br />Vitamins and Minerals<br />Vitamin E supplement<br />Vitamin A supplement<br />Vitamin D3 supplement<br />Zinc Sulfate<br />Thiamine Mononitrate<br />Manganese sulfate<br />Menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of vitamin K activity)<br />Riboflavin supplement<br />Folic acid<br />Pyridoxine hydrochloride<br />Copper amino acid complex<br />Iron amino acid complex<br /><br />First of all, it\\'s great that the manufacturer has whole seafood as the major ingredients (as opposed to the by-products, meal, grains, etc). But there is one item which I would not have expected to find in something of this quality: Menadione sodium bisuifite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for the K vitamins and has been reported, at high doses, to have toxic effects. Moreover, I had actually never seen menadione listed as an ingredient in other cat foods (though there seem to be others out there).<br /><br />A little bit of Internet sleuthing yielded some disturbing information, which I feel obliged to list here.<br /><br />*Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It\\'s also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />*There are safer alternatives to menadione for proper K vitamin-related functions (e.g. blood clotting). The use of menadione over the alternatives (leafy greens, kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food.<br /><br />*A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione \"produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung.\" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />*Menadione\\'s toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />There seems to be a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of menadione in pet food: [...]<br /><br />Does this information mean that this food is bad for our cats, when normal doses are given? I don\\'t know for sure, but I wish that I\\'d been more aware about this ingredient before feeding it to my cats. Admittedly, more research needs to be done regarding this subject.

       "  'text': \"These just arrived, and I was first taken aback by how small the jar is (perhaps a squat half-gallon size), and it it is a scant two thirds full, not full to the top, as shown in the picture of the product (I am aware of the issue of settling, but trust me, you can't shake these enough to come close to the volume shown, in fact it is closer half full now). It is difficult to tell from a photo, but somehow I thought it was one of the large jars you you see in convenience stores; not even close. The silver dollar size is near accurate, each round is slightly larger than a silver dollar (this is a ground and formed beef jerky, not a natural muscle meat product, so the item size is consistent). The lid bears a large red label marked for retail sales at four for a dollar, which means that for the price I just paid ($18.82 for one jar), for the purchase of the entire jar, you are getting a bonus of about four of the little rounds off the full retail price if sold individually, or just under $.23.5 per bite size round. Curiously, there is a blank where it clearly shows the product weight should be listed, but I would estimate no more than a pound, tops. As to value for the price, I'd give it maybe two stars.<br /><br />This is a smoked, peppered beef jerky product, and I can see what appears to be pepper in the formed meat, but the flavor is quite mild on both counts. It isn't bad, but it's nothing to write home about, either. In all fairness, I like peppered meat, so I was looking for very peppery flavor; if you like a very mild pepper flavor you might be quite pleased. There is no natural grain to the meat, so it is sort of an odd leathery texture(much like fruit leather does not retain the original texture of the fruit). To me, this tastes about like a less salty than usual traditional jerky, which usually has some pepper; but being advertised as a peppered product, to my tastes, it falls short. I would give it a three on flavor; it tastes alright, just not a great spicy, peppery jerky.<br /><br />Over all, it doesn't taste bad, and I'm not going to throw it out, but it wasn't what I expected, either value or taste wise; I wouldn't buy it again.\"},\n",

       "  'text': '* This is a review for the 1.25oz Kickin\\' Teriyaki  flavor Beef Jerky *<br /><br />Beef Jerky has always been one of my favorite snacking foods. I even used to make my own when I was younger. I\\'ve tried a variety of brands before but this is the first time trying out Wild Ride. It claims to be Hormone and Nitrate free with no added MSG, and while the ingredients listed do confirm their claims this beef jerky has got to be some of the driest, tasteless I have ever eaten.<br /><br />Kickin\\' Teriyaki is the flavor I got. To be sure I didn\\'t just get a bad package I opened two bags and both sets of jerky was dry and tasteless. I do not taste anything \"kickin\" about this jerky and there is virtually no Teriyaki flavor either. To make things worse the dry jerky tends to have a powdery taste to it because it is made with Soy Sauce POWDER instead of Soy Sauce (this is to get around saying it has no added MSG). Instead of imparting a nice Teriyaki flavor you get this powedery taste to the jerky and mixed with the bit of onion and corn starch in the jerky, it almost is like they coated it with onion powder instead of Teriyaki.<br /><br />On the plus side however, this is a nitrate free product which is a good thing as many other jerkies tend to have Sodium Nitrate in them. Also with both packages I have opened currently, the jerky breaks down easily and isn\\'t tough as leather nor does it contain any sinew it seems.<br /><br />OVERALL this jerky just seems extremely tasteless and powdery. While it doesn\\'t contain \"added\" MSG, Nitrates or hormones, they got around this by using powdered versions of ingredients (powdered vinegar and soy sauce) plus it contains Dextrose and Fructose , modified food starch and corn starch and SUGAR is your second ingredient. I\\'ve never seen so much sugar and starch added to jerky in my life. So despite being hormone and nitrate free, this jerky (in my opinion) is barely palatable and should be avoided'},\n",

Bruegie mostly only likes wet food especially tuna (Sheba Tuna entr&eacute;e is her favorite)...oh, and cheese; we call her the cheese-monger. Banjo mostly likes dry food; he has become carbo-kittie...he begs for bread and crackers.<br /><br />Now that the intended consumers have been introduced, here\\'s their review: Eh, I\\'m bored.<br /><br />When I looked at the can, I was overjoyed. No wheat gluten and all natural ingredients plus a few vitamins. When I opened the first can, I was even happier; Bruegie likes the foods with more liquid in them and these are fish chunks and lots of liquid. However, when I set the plates down, they were ignored. When it was time for clean-up, most of the food was still there. We have now gone through every flavour in the box...with the same result.<br /><br />The first time we set down a can of Sheba (which wasn\\'t too long ago) Bruegie was all over it and Banjo tried to muscle in. When we are feeding her something she can tell is her favorite (from the smell when we open the can, I suppose,) Bruegie will beg...none of that.<br /><br />All that said, as any cat owner will tell you, EVERY cat is different... and next week, we might be looking at clean plates, but for now the Capehart-Stephenson Kitties are having none of this. The three stars are for the ingredients, hopefully your cats will like it more than ours.'},\n",

I especially like the toffee flavor which I put in my fake coffee.  It is evidently a popular flavor because it is often out of stock on the various website that sell it.  I don\\'t use caffiene and real coffee has a wickedly bitter after taste.  Stevia has completely replaced sugar in my kitchen.  I use it in everything from cereal to baking.  This is a good price.  I like the Sweet Leaf cream soda, but it is expensive. Their toffee flavor is too strong.<br /><br />I am surprised by the number of reviewers who use artificial sweetners, such as the exotoxic aspartame- NutraSweet (the most poisonous), Sweet N Low (at least the body recognizes it as a chemical so it doesn\\'t pass through the blood brain barrier), Splendia, Sucralose, etc. Now there is a new toxin spewing from the malevolent (yes, what would you call a company who has developed anti-nature terminator seeds?!) Monsanto called Neotame, which is unbelievably being labeled as \"organic\". Stevia is actually good for you. I try to avoid any product, especially food, that is made in China, although it is nearly impossible to do these days, particularily if you shop at Wal-mart (the great Wal of China).  By the way, aspartame is a terrific ant killer and Sweet n low is rat poison.  I am surprised that they aren\\'t used in chemotherapy.

About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  \"What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes \"cheaper\". I don\\'t know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.\"  I did receive a reply: \"Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the \"best before\" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.\"  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the \"bad\" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same...'},\n",

       "  'text': \"This is my second Super Automatic Espresso Maker. It's the lowest priced model available and is pretty good considering the price. The lack of extra features is not a problem. However there are some issues you might like to know before buying. Overall, it makes a decent espresso at the touch of a button. It's easy to clean and maintain and for that alone it's worth it since it saves you so much time.<br /><br />The quality of the espresso is decent - not bad, but not great either. It's far superior to drip coffee and easier than grinding your own beans. It took about a week to get the dosage and grinder settings to where I was satisfied. The defaults didn't use enough beans and the grind was too course which made the espresso quite bitter. You don't want run too much water through the grinds once the initial flavor is extracted.<br /><br />The temperature of the espresso is a little low. It's fine if you drink it right away or don't add cold milk. The only other little issue is the frother dispenses quite a bit of water before the actual steam. Therefore you have to use a second cup and run it for a few seconds until the steam flows consistently, then switch to your milk so you don't dilute it. Not a big deal but my last machine didn't require this step.<br /><br />Finally, the last issue has to do with the horrible packaging. The main box is contained in an outer box that's almost twice its size. The problem is there was NO PADDING whatsoever in the outer box, so the inner one is left to get slammed around throughout its entire shipping journey. My machine become separated along the main seam that runs all the way around the unit so it didn't even close properly until I pushed it back into place - there's still a small crack on one of the plastic pieces. Also, some of the buttons popped off. I would have returned it but it's kind of a hassle to ship something so large and it still works okay, so not a big deal, but wouldn't order one from here again.<br /><br />The bottom line is Super Automatic Espresso makers are an amazing convenience for those who appreciate fresh coffee. The quality is much better than the pod makers and far easier than grinding your own beans and making a whole pot at a time. The espresso isn't as good as a manual machine and this model doesn't have any fancy features, but still an amazing value for the price.\"},\n",

I eat almost entirely organic foods and really needed a more affordable hazelnut flavoring for my coffee. Currently, I am using Flavorganics Hazelnut, which is EXACLTY the flavor I love, but I was looking for something a little more affordable.<br /><br />The taste is just off. And it isn't the agave. I love both light and dark agave from Madhava. It has a chemical or artificial taste to it and I couldn't do more than two sips of coffee to tell I needed to get rid of the entire 6-pack. I am going to see if Amazon will take them back, even if I have to pay shipping, because I think it is offensively bad.<br /><br />The Flavorganics has actual organic hazelnut extractives, which taste like real hazelnuts, like the ones in Justin's hazelnut nut butter.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Updated Review (03-10-12)<br /><br />I notified Amazon that I was extremely displeased with the quality of this product. Even though it is clearly not the fault of Amazon nor their responsibility to ensure I am happy, they went out of their way to make me an even happier customer than I normally am. I mean, we spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazon, easily, and I think it is one of the best companies in the world. If we can't find it on Amazon or at Trader Joe's, then we probably don't need it.<br /><br />I still think this product is terrible, and I have always thought that the starred reviews should reflect ONLY the quality of the product, for better or worse.

They seem to have perfected the ratio of flour to sugar, so that the cookie is delicious without weighing you down with excessive sugary sweetness (this is again in contrast to their horrible new cookies).<br /><br />I have absolutely no idea why Entenmann\\'s decided to nearly eliminate their sales of the classical recipe and replace it with these disgusting brands. It seems to have happened when the Entenmann name was bought by a larger multinational company, so it was probably a money-saving opportunity. The Original Recipe cookies likely have expensive ingredients.<br /><br />The only problem is they are so hard to find: thank goodness they are now on Amazon!!!'},\n",

Their ages ranged from 1 year to 16 years. Their weights ranged from 8 pounds to 16 pounds. Twelve of these cats eat Purina One Chicken & Rice dry cat food or Purina One Senior formula, which is a chicken formula. Four of those also eat other types of dry cat food. The sixteen year old cat eats Purina One Salmon & Tuna. Eight of the cats only eat canned tuna or seafood type canned food--namely Meow Mix's Market Select types with no chicken or wheat gluten. The other 5 eat seafood, chicken, turkey or beef canned foods.<br /><br />I was surprised at the results...only one cat, a one year old outside male, of questionable ownership, ate both the Chicken Pot Pie & Chinese Chicken every time he was offered it. Actually, he eats anything he is offered, and is very well fed. He loves meat, too. Another outside cat--a 2 year old male--ate the Chicken Pot Pie every time he was offered it, but would not eat the Chinese Chicken. A third male--a 16 pound inside/outside orange tabby--would consume all the juice of the Chicken Pot Pie, and would eat only some of the chicken. Most of the other cats would also consume the broth of the Chicken Pot Pie, but would not touch the meat. The Chicken Pot Pie has lots of broth, which I think is brilliant, since all the cats I know always like the broth of canned cat food or tuna best.<br /><br />I don't know why this canned cat food was not better liked.

Corn is an inexpensive and controversial cereal grain of only modest nutritional value to a dog.<br />For this reason, we do not consider corn a preferred component in any dog food.<br />The second item is chicken by-product meal... a dry rendered product of slaughterhouse waste. It\\'s made from what\\'s left of a slaughtered chicken after all the prime cuts have been removed.<br />In a nutshell, chicken by-products are those unsavory leftovers usually considered \"unfit for human consumption\".<br />In addition to organs (the nourishing part), this stuff can contain almost anything... feet, beaks, undeveloped eggs... anything (that is) except skeletal muscle (real meat).'},\n",

I cooked the sauce in a separate sauce pan and added it to the drained pasta after it had cooked and thickened a bit. I also added maybe 1/2 teaspoon of mustard. Sauce was very creamy, but not big on flavor really. I ended up adding salt, cayenne pepper, and after all else failed, threw in maybe 1/3 cup of pepperjack daiya (don\\'t usually buy that stuff either so it was lucky I did today!). After the addition of a little Daiya it was really good. It was relatively cheap for being a vegan cheeze product, I think like $2.00 or so. I will probably buy it from time to time, but I can\\'t give something that came in a box a 5 star review when I had to add so much to it (and change the cooking instructions!) This is probably great for vegan/extremely lactose intolerant kids who haven\\'t ever really had the Kraft stuff. Definitely better than the real thing nutritionally (well maybe not after I was done with it...).'},\n",

I tried it with its companion product, Clear Scalp Hair Beauty Damage and Color Repair Nourishing Conditioner (how's that for a long name?) and found they work well together. The shampoo is a little less effective at adding body than some other shampoos, and overall I like the conditioner better than the shampoo. But I have very fine, curly hair that's temperamental, so another person might not have the same experience. All in all, I'd say this product is worth a try.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'Oy. I found these on sale at a local grocery store and decided to try them, hoping they\\'d be deelish and I could start ordering them from Amazon. No luck.<br /><br />First of all, I should have known they\\'d be a bit. . .well, bland. The tomato  \"sauce\" is a product of water and tomato paste, which I normally wouldn\\'t consider worth much. The sauce is a very light red color (more orange than red, really), very thin (by my standards, anyway), and an oddly bland sweet flavor that really did not light my fire. Of course, nothing canned ever stands up to the \"real\" thing, but this is, to me, beyond the norm when it comes to blandness.<br /><br />The ravioli themselves are very mushy and tend to separate as soon as I touch them with my fork. The bottom layer comes off, the cheese inside begins to mix with the sauce, and soon I have pasta squares instead of ravioli. A cheesy blandness rather than the original tomatoey blandness. Yuck.<br /><br />They aren\\'t the worst I\\'ve ever had, but I was hoping I would like them more than the usual crap out there, like the Chef Boyardee ravioli (which actually taste good in comparison to these--yowsa!).<br /><br />I give this product a three because of the ingredients being organic, but man--spice it up a little, Annie\\'s! Or at least, add some tomato chunks in there, or maybe use pasta that won\\'t separate when you barely touch it.'},\n",

Sorry to be so graphic but that's the truth.  It's hard to give my dog food that I dont even want to touch.  She loved the taste, though, and that was the important thing.<br /><br />That night, however, my poor dog was in agony and had black, watery diarrhea all over the house.  Twenty-four hours later she still wasnt feeling well.
