### **Objectives**

1. Recall the statements of the **(strong/weak) law of large numbers** and the **central limit theorem** and know to apply these for large sample sizes.
2. (Optional:) Apply **Hoeffding's inequality** to the sample means of bounded i.i.d. random variables.
3. Recall the probability density function and properties of the **Gaussian distribution** .
4. Use **Gaussian probability tables** to obtain probabilities and **quantiles** .
5. Distinguish between **convergence almost surely** , **convergence in probability** and **convergence in distribution** , understand that these notions are from strongest to weakest.
6. Determine convergence of sums and products of sequences that converge almost surely or in probability.
7. Apply **Slutsky's theorem** to the sum and product of a sequence that converges in distribution and another that converges in probability to a constant.
8. Use the **continuous mapping theorem** to determine convergence of sequences of a function of random variables.
