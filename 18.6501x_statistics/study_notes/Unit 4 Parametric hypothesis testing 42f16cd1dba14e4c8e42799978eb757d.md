# 1. Motivation

- Reformulate experimental questions in terms of a **hypothesis test** by specifying an appropriate **null hypothesis** and an **alternative hypothesis** .
- **Design** statistical **tests** to decide between a null and alternative hypothesis.
- Understand the types of error of a test
- Compute the power function of a test
- Design statistical tests with a specific level or asymptotic level.
- Apply a test to a given sample to determine whether or not the null hypothesis should be rejected.
- Compute a test from a confidence interval
- Compute and interpret the p-value associated to a statistical test.
