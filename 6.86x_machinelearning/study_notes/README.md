# 6.86x Machine Learning

Welcome to 6.86x *Machine Learning with Python–From Linear Models to Deep Learning*.

Machine learning methods are commonly used across engineering and sciences, from computer systems to physics. Moreover, commercial sites such as search engines, recommender systems (e.g., Netflix, Amazon), advertisers, and financial institutions employ machine learning algorithms for content recommendation, predicting customer behavior, compliance, or risk.

As a discipline, machine learning tries to design and understand computer programs that learn from experience for the purpose of prediction or control.

In this course, you will learn about principles and algorithms for turning training data into effective automated predictions. We will cover:

- Representation, over-fitting, regularization, generalization, VC dimension;
- Clustering, classification, recommender problems, probabilistic modeling, reinforcement learning;
- On-line algorithms, support vector machines, and neural networks/deep learning.

You will be able to:

1. Understand principles behind machine learning problems such as classification, regression, clustering, and reinforcement learning
2. Implement and analyze models such as linear models, kernel machines, neural networks, and graphical models
3. Choose suitable models for different applications
4. Implement and organize machine learning projects, from training, validation, parameter tuning, to feature engineering

You will implement and experiment with the algorithms in several Python projects designed for different practical applications
