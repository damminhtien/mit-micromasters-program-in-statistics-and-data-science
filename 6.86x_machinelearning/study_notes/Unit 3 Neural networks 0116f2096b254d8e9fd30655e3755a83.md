# Unit 3: Neural networks

At the end of this unit, you will be able to

- Implement a **feedforward neural networks** from scratch to perform image classification task.
- Write down the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weight parameters using **back-propagation** algorithm and use SGD to train neural networks.
- Understand that **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and **long short-term memory (LSTM)** can be applied in modeling and generating sequences.
- Implement a **Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** with machine learning packages.
