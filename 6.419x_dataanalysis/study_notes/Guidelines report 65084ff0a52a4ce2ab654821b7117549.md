# Guidelines report

Here are some guidelines and rules for the report and peer review.

- Your report will be in the form of **1 single pdf file** .
- Your report will be written in **English** .
- Abide by the **word limit** of any problem that explicitly states a limit.
- Present the best analysis/solution you can. This means including **plots** , **equations,** along with **clear explanations** when necessary.
- **You are allowed to discuss and collaborate with one another but you must prepare and write your own report, independently.** Everyone must submit a report on their own.
- If you collaborate with others in your report, you must **include the edX usernames of your collaborators at the top of your report** .
- **All reports will be visible to everyone after submission.**
- During peer grading, you must read the report you are grading carefully, **compare the report with the given rubric, record and briefly explain the score for each part.** You are also encouraged to make comments and questions that help your peers improve their reports. **You will be given points if your comment is selected as a valuable comment by one of your peers** .
- During peer grading, you will assign points based on the supplied rubric. The rubric will serve as a guide; however, some of the reports that you read may not follow the structure in the rubric exactly. In these cases, you should examine the rubric to find the important concepts that are being graded, and then **assess for yourself if the report demonstrates understanding of those concepts** . **If you are unsure on whether to assign a point or not, we ask that you err on the side of leniency and give the report the point in question.**

**Important note:**

- Your reports, and comments both in the peer review and open discussion sessions, will be shown with your usernames and visible to all learners in this course.
- Hence you will know who your reviewers are, but you will only see the average of the scores received from the different reviews.
