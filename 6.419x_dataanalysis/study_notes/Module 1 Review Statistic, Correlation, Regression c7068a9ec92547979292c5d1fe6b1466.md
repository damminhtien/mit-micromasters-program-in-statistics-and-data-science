# Module 1: Review Statistic, Correlation, Regression, Gradient Descent

[Lecture 1: Observational studies and experiments](Module%201%20Review%20Statistic,%20Correlation,%20Regression%20c7068a9ec92547979292c5d1fe6b1466/Lecture%201%20Observational%20studies%20and%20experiments%20efead53968c8424b9234fa4deb488d49.md)

This lecture sets up the basics of randomized experiments, hypothesis testing, and data modeling. The next two lectures will then cover further methods for hypothesis testing and approaches to multiple hypothesis testing. They will build on the basic methods in this lecture to achieve better methodological accuracy and more generalizable models.

The discussion will be guided by a study conducted by the Health Insurance Program that offered mammographies for early detection of breast cancer, where the objective is to determine whether offering mammographies will lead to fewer deaths due to breast cancer. From this example, we will discuss two main considerations:

- the role of proper **experimental design** in setting up the study
- considerations for the **data collection process** in order to do **valid inference**

As you follow the discussion videos, your main take-away should not be particular details about this study. Rather, you should focus on developing an intuition on the important considerations for a study, as you may be conducting similar experiments or analyzing similar datasets of your interest in the future.

[Lecture 2: Hypothesis testing](Module%201%20Review%20Statistic,%20Correlation,%20Regression%20c7068a9ec92547979292c5d1fe6b1466/Lecture%202%20Hypothesis%20testing%20ef648a22fc1244b6847eb638412ce83d.md)

At the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

- Perform the **Fisher Exact Test** , and compute the p-value using the **hypergeometric distribution** .
- Apply the **z-test** and the **t-tests** on continuous data.
- **Set up and perform hypothesis tests** under assumptions and scenarios simular to the studies discussed.
- **Choose appropriate test statistic** for hypothesis tests and find their distributions.
- Discuss the usage and assumptions of the **t-statistic** and the **t-distribution** .
- Use various tests to evaluate whether a data set can be considered **approximately normal** .
- Compute a **confidence interval** for a parameter.

[**Lecture 3: Likelihood Ratio Test and Multiple Hypothesis Testing**](Module%201%20Review%20Statistic,%20Correlation,%20Regression%20c7068a9ec92547979292c5d1fe6b1466/Lecture%203%20Likelihood%20Ratio%20Test%20and%20Multiple%20Hypot%20eb9c35a3a5c441de9d73f62b5d796e50.md)

At the end of this lecture, you will be able to

- Apply the **Likelihood Ratio Test** on the HIP mammography experiment and other similar scenarios.
- Define **family-wise error rate (FWER)** and **false discovery rate (FDR)** for a series of hypothesis tests and choose which of these to control in different scenarios of multiple hypothesis tests.
- Compute p-value corrections such as the **Bonferroni correction** and **Holm-Bonferroni correction** , to control the family-wise error rate (FWER).
- Compute p-value corrections such as the **Benjamini-Hochberg correction method** to control the false discovery rate (FDR).

[Lecture 4: **Correlation and Least Squares Regression**](Module%201%20Review%20Statistic,%20Correlation,%20Regression%20c7068a9ec92547979292c5d1fe6b1466/Lecture%204%20Correlation%20and%20Least%20Squares%20Regression%205a8d68c0f09c4717ba2933ba49d5bac2.md)

In this lecture and series of exercises you will learn:

- The concepts of variance and covariance of data.
- What the correlation coefficient is and how it relates to covariance.
- How linear regression relates to correlation.
- How to transform data with nonlinear relationship so that they may be analyzed with linear regression.
- The extension of linear regression to multiple dimensions.
- Application of the t-test to determine the significance of predictors in a multidimensional linear model.
