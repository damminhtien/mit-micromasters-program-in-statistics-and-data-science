# I. Sugesting Similar Papers

A citation network is a directed network where the vertices are academic papers and there is a directed edge from paper A to paper B if paper A cites paper B in its bibliography. **Google Scholar** performs automated citation indexing and has a useful feature that allows users to find similar papers. In the following, we analyze two approaches for measuring similarity between papers.

**Part (a): Co-citation network**

Two papers are said to be cocited if they are both cited by the same third paper. The edge weights in the cocitation network correspond to the number of cocitations. In this part, we will discover how to compute the (weighted) adjacency matrix of the cocitation network from the adjacency matrix of the citation network.

- **Problem setup:** In order to derive the cocitation matrix, we need to derive it as a function of the original adjacency matrix.
- **Problem notation:** If there is an edge from paper i to paper j, it means that paper i cites paper j. We will denote by A the corresponding adjacency matrix, such that $A_{ij} = 1$ means there is a directed edge from i to j. Let us denote by C the cocitation network matrix.

## Part a) Question 1

Let's analyze the given algorithm step by step to determine if it generates the cocitation weighted adjacency matrix and to find its time complexity.

**Algorithm Analysis**

1. **Initial Setup:**
    - Construct an empty matrix C.
2. **Iterating through rows of A:**
    - For each row r of A, check if the row sum is strictly greater than 1.
    - If true, consider each pair (a, b) in row r that are non-zero.
    - Add 1 to C at location (a, b).

### 1. Does this generate the cocitation weighted adjacency matrix?

**Cocitation Matrix Definition:**

- A cocitation matrix C captures the number of times pairs of papers are cited together.
- C(i, j) indicates the number of papers that cite both paper i and paper j.

**Analysis:**

- The algorithm iterates over each row r of A, where row r corresponds to a paper citing others.
- For each row, if the paper cites more than one other paper (row sum > 1), it identifies all pairs of papers (a, b) that are cited together.
- For each pair (a, b), it increments the corresponding entry in the cocitation matrix C.

This process accurately counts the number of times pairs of papers are cited together, which matches the definition of the cocitation matrix.

**Conclusion:** Yes, this algorithm generates the cocitation weighted adjacency matrix.

### 2. What is the big-O complexity of the proposed algorithm in terms of n, the number of nodes in the graph?

**Complexity Analysis:**

- Let n be the number of nodes (papers).
- The algorithm iterates through each row of the matrix A. If A is an $n \times n$ matrix, this means iterating n rows.

For each row:

- Checking the row sum: This operation takes $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time as we need to sum up n entries.
- If the row sum is greater than 1, find all pairs of non-zero entries: In the worst case, there could be  $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ pairs to consider if the row is fully populated with citations.

Combining these steps:

- Summing up each row: $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$
- Finding pairs in each row: $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ in the worst case (since for each of the n rows, there could be $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ pairs).

**Conclusion:** The overall time complexity of the algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$.

## Part a) Question 2: Write the cocitation weighted adjacency matrix, C, in terms of A using matrix operations.

Use `A^T` for $A^{\intercal }$ and `*` for matrix multiplication. The diagonals in your answer need not match the diagonals generated by the definition in Question 1, the off-diagonals should match Question 1.

To derive the cocitation weighted adjacency matrix C in terms of A using matrix operations, let's consider the logical AND operation for edges (k, i) and (k, j) being present in the graph. Step-by-Step Derivation:

1. Understanding Cocitation:
    - Cocitation occurs when two papers are cited together by another paper.
    - For each pair of papers i and j, count the number of papers k that cite both i and j.
2. Logical AND Operation:
    - For a given row k, $A_{ki}$ and $A_{kj}$ both need to be 1 for papers i and j to be cited together by paper k.
    - This can be represented as $A_{ki} \times A_{kj}$.
3. Matrix Product Interpretation:
    - Summing $A_{ki} \times A_{kj}$ over all rows k gives the cocitation count for papers i and j.
    - This can be achieved by multiplying $A^T$ with A.
4. Constructing the Cocitation Matrix C:
    - The product $A^T * A$ naturally gives the required cocitation counts for the off-diagonal elements.

**Matrix Representation: $C = A^T A$**

**Explanation:**

- The element $C_{ij}$ of matrix C is calculated as the sum of products of corresponding elements from the i-th column and j-th column of A: $C_{ij} = \sum_{k} A_{ki} \times A_{kj}$
- This sum is exactly what the matrix product $A^T A$ computes.

**Diagonals:**

- The diagonal elements $C_{ii}$ will count the number of times paper i is cited by all papers, which is not the primary interest but included as a result of the matrix product.

## Part b) **Bibliographic coupling**

Two papers are said to be bibliographically coupled if they cite the same other papers. The edge weights in a bibliographic coupling correspond to the number of common citations between two papers.

How do you compute the (weighted) adjacency matrix of the bibliographic coupling, B, from the adjacency matrix of the citation network, A? Write your answer in terms of matrix operations.
