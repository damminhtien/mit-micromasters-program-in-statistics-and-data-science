# Written Analysis Format Requirements

We have provided a [Word template](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/15a6ed69baae4b4ea69172a24d52b6df/asset-v1:MITx+6.419x+2T2024+type@asset+block/resources_Written_report_template.docx) for the written report. You are encouraged to write your report in any word processor that you feel most comfortable with that supports figure and formula writing or insertions (e.g. Latex, Word etc).

If you are not using the template provide above, please make sure to follow the format requirements below:

- The text should be written in **one column with single line spacing**.
- Use 11 point Times New Roman font for all the main text, and **italics font only for the question**.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** In upcoming assignments, you may choose to use a Jupyter notebook for your analysis. However, you are expected to **write up your report separately with clear statements interspersed with supporting figures/graphs with caption when necessary**. Please **DO NOT submit a report which is a direct automated conversion of a Jupyter notebook**.
- **Code:** When a code segment (generally less than 10 lines) is included in your report, you can incorporate the code segment centered on a single row in the main text (using a different font). For **longer code segments, please include in an Appendix after the main text**.
- **Submission format and naming:** Please upload your written report as a PDF file, and name the file with “HW_Module#_yourname.pdf", where “#" is replaced by the module number, and “yourname" by your edX username.

**Hints for writing:**

- Every claim in your answer needs to be properly motivated and justified; otherwise, you may lose all or part of the score in grading.
- Try to start your answer with stating your opinion first. Then prove your argument with examples, derivation, and/or points based on the information in the lecture or reading materials.
- If you have a formula or some derivation process involved in your answer, putting the math expression in a separate line is encouraged. For example, a formula

$$
a^2+b^2+2ab=(a+b)^2,
$$

where $a$ and $b$ are reals.

- Use bold sparingly for emphasis to make certain words and phrases, such as terminology, key words, stand out from the surrounding text.
- Try to use precise and clear language in your answer.
