# Submission and Peer Review Process

At the end of each module, you will complete an analysis (or homework in Module 1) that involves both auto-graded and open-ended responses.

The format of the analysis will be similar to this practice report, where the autograded and open-ended problems are interleaved. The open-ended problems will not have an answer box. You will be expected to prepare your responses and submit a single pdf.

Your submission will be commented on and graded by peers, and you will expected to comment on your peers' submissions.
