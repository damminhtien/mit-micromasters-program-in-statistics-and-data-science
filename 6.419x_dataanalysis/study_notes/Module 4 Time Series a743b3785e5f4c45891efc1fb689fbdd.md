# Module 4: Time Series

At the end of the is lecture, you should be able to

- Understand the definition of time series.
- Understand the definition of stationary and non-stationary time series.
- Understand the relationship and difference between weak and strong stationarity.
- For a given time series data, plot it and identify the trend and seasonality.
- Use appropriate methods to remove the trend and seasonality.
- Use ACF as a diagnostic tool to study the dependence structure of a time series

A **time series** is a special kind of statistical data, specifically, it is a collection of numerical measurements, called **observations** $x_1, \ldots , x_ t, \ldots , x_ n \in \mathbb {R}$ that are indexed by a time stamp $t=1,\ldots ,n$. These time stamps must form a deterministic sequence and be regularly spaced in time with equal intervals between any two adjacent stamps. For the purposes of statistical inferences with these data, the observations are modeled mathematically as realizations of a corresponding series (i.e., sequence) of random variables $X_1,\ldots , X_ t,\dots , X_ n:\Omega \to \mathbb {R}$ that are defined on some common probability space $(\Omega ,\mathbf{P})$. As with other types of statistical data, what is observed by the statistician is a particular outcome of a specialized probability model: $x_1 = X_1(\omega ), \dots , x_ t = X_ t(\omega ), \dots , x_ n = X_ n(\omega ),$ for an outcome $\omega \in \Omega$ in some probability space $(\Omega ,\mathbf{P})$.

The probability model is such that we have one random variable for each time stamp and one observation for each random variable. All these random variables are defined on a common probability space, so we can speak of probabilities of joint events that involve any number of these random variables. The realizations come from the real world where they occur sequentially in time in the order of the time stamp index $t$, so that $x_ t$ is observed before $x_{t+1}$. Also, the observations arrive at a fixed time interval, so that the time that elapses between observing $x_ t$ and $x_{t+1}$ is the same for all $t$.

## **Dependence in Time Series**

The most important feature of time series data is that we make no assumption about **independence** of these random variables. Recall that independence was our fundamental assumption in the context of cross-section data that are obtained by random sampling from a fixed population, which we studied in e.g. 18.6501x. In fact, most time series data are **dependent** , typically because past realizations influence future observations through the nature of the real world phenomenon that produces these data. It is fair to say, that the main goal of time-series analysis is to first model and then estimate from data (guided by the model) the dependence structure of these random variables.

Statistical dependence in a time series is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, dependence **helps** us make predictions about the future realizations from knowledge of the past realizations. E.g., if yesterday was warm, today will probably be warm as well. On the other hand, dependence poses technical challenges in the distributional analysis of estimators. This is because there is effectively less statistical information in dependent data about the data generating process, as compared to the case of independent observations. E.g., the basic laws of large numbers and central limit theorems do not even apply!

To gain some intuition for our discussion of time series, consider the following examples:

- Economic data: stock prices, inflation rate, GDP, employment rate, interest rate, exchange rates;
- Biometric data: heart rate, blood pressure, weight, fMRI;
- Environmental data: temperature, precipitation, pressure, humidity, pollution;
- Sound data: speech, music;

In all these examples, as well as in a general time series, data take the form of **discrete** measurements of a real world phenomena that evolves **continuously** in time. A general probabilistic model to describe such phenomena is called a **stochastic process** , which is simply a collection of random variables $\{X_ t\}$ indexed by either a continuous or discrete time parameter $t$. So, a time series data set can be thought of as a **single realization** of a stochastic process. Each random variable $X_ t$ has a marginal distribution $\mathrm{P}_{t}$. The process $\{ X_ t\} _{t>0}$ as a whole also has a probability law, which can be thought of as the **joint** distribution of all the $X_ t$'s. (Interestingly, this joint distribution of the entire process, whether continuous or discrete, is completely characterized by the collection of all the finite-dimensional marginal distributions $\mathrm{P}_{t_1,..,t_ k}$ of random vectors $(X_{t_1},\dots ,X_{t_ k})$ where $k$ ranges over all integers and time indexes $t_1,\dots ,t_ k$ range over all distinct time stamps.)

## **Deterministic dependencies in time series: trend, seasonality**

### Trend ($m_X(t)$)

This is the long-term movement in a time series, without considering periodic fluctuations (seasonality) or irregular effects (noise). The trend $m_X(t)$ is a component of the mean function $\mu_X(t)$ and reflects non-cyclical, possibly non-linear changes over time. Trends can be upward, downward, or even follow more complex patterns, and are often monotone.

### Seasonal Variation ($s_X(t)$)

This refers to regular, predictable patterns that repeat over a known period. It is cyclical and captures fluctuations that occur at specific intervals, such as daily, monthly, or quarterly. The function $s_X(t)$ is periodic and a key part of $\mu_X(t)$, capturing these regular cycles.

### **Random Component ($W_t$)**

This is the white noise component of the time series. White noise is a random variable with a mean of zero and a constant variance, and each instance of white noise is independent of the others. This component adds randomness to the series, making it unpredictable and varying from one realization to another.

### Marginal Mean Function ($\mu_X(t)$)

- **Marginal Mean Function**: $\mu_X(t) = m_X(t) + s_X(t)+W_t$. This function represents the expected value or average behavior of the time series at any point in time $t$. It incorporates both the trend and the seasonal components, providing a comprehensive view of the deterministic dependencies in the time series.

### Decomposition Formula

The equation \( \mu_X(t) = m_X(t) + s_X(t) \) serves as a decomposition of the mean function into its fundamental deterministic components: trend and seasonal variation. This decomposition helps in understanding, modeling, and forecasting time series data by separately addressing these components.

### Practical Implications

- **Modeling and Forecasting**: Understanding and quantifying the trend and seasonal variation can significantly enhance the accuracy of time series models, particularly in forecasting. Models can be adjusted to account for these components, improving predictions.
- **Data Analysis**: Analysts can use this decomposition to detrend and deseasonalize data, simplifying the analysis of the underlying processes.

### Visualization in Practice

- **Sample Paths**: In the context of the article, "sample paths" refer to visual representations (plots) of different realizations of the time series model. Each path is typically shown in a unique color to distinguish between different realizations under varying conditions, such as different levels of noise.
- **Sub-figures**: These are used to illustrate how variations in model parameters (like noise) affect the behavior of the time series. Understanding these effects can help in refining the models to better capture the dynamics of the actual processes.

### Conclusion

The article underscores the importance of recognizing and modeling deterministic dependencies in time series data. By accurately identifying and extracting trends and seasonal variations, analysts and statisticians can better understand the data's behavior and make more accurate forecasts. This approach is fundamental in various applications across fields like economics, finance, environmental science, and more.

## Stochastic Dependence in Time Series Data

Stochastic dependence in time series data refers to the statistical interdependence between random variables at different time points. This concept is pivotal in understanding the behavior of time series data across various fields such as economics, environmental studies, biometrics, and more.

### Definition of Stochastic Dependence

Stochastic dependence implies that the joint distribution of a collection of random variables does not decompose into the product of their marginal distributions. In simpler terms, the future values in a time series are influenced by its past values, and knowing these past values can alter our expectations for the future.

### Independence vs. Dependence

To understand stochastic dependence, it's useful to contrast it with independence:

- **Independence**: Two random variables \(X_s\) and \(X_t\) are independent if knowing the value of \(X_s\) does not provide any information about the likely value of \(X_t\). Mathematically, \(X_s\) and \(X_t\) are independent if the conditional probability distribution of \(X_t\) given \(X_s\) is the same as the unconditional distribution of \(X_t\).
- **Dependence**: If \(X_s\) and \(X_t\) are dependent, knowledge of \(X_s\) affects the probability distribution of \(X_t\). This is the core feature of time series where \(X_t\) often depends on \(X_s\), \(s < t\).

### Practical Examples of Dependence

In various practical datasets, dependence is a common feature:

- **Economic Data**: Variables like stock prices and inflation rates are dependent on their past values. Stock prices, for example, are typically modeled as dependent on previous prices even though the day-to-day changes might seem random (efficient market hypothesis).
- **Biometric Data**: Measures such as heart rate and blood pressure show dependence both across time and on external factors like activity level or stress.
- **Environmental Data**: Environmental measurements such as temperature or humidity show clear dependence patterns, often with strong seasonal trends.

### Autocovariance Function

The autocovariance function, denoted as \(\gamma_X(s, t)\), is a crucial measure in time series analysis. It quantifies the linear association between values at different times in the series:
\[ \gamma_X(s, t) = \textsf{Cov}[X_s, X_t] = \mathbf{E}[(X_s - \mu_X(s))(X_t - \mu_X(t))], \]
where \(\mu_X(t)\) is the mean function of the series. This function helps identify how changes in the series at one point in time are associated with changes at another point.

- **For series where observations are close in time**: There is often a strong correlation, and the values appear smoother.
- **As the time gap increases**: The correlation typically decreases, unless the series exhibits long-range dependence.

### Marginal Variance Function

The marginal variance function, \(\gamma_X(t, t)\), reflects the inherent variability in the series at different points:
\[ \gamma_X(t, t) = \textsf{Var}[X_t] = \mathbf{E}[(X_t - \mu_X(t))^2]. \]
It describes how much the values of the series can deviate from the mean, indicating the level of uncertainty or noise at each point in time.

### Conclusion

Understanding stochastic dependence is fundamental in forecasting and modeling time series data. By analyzing how past values influence future values, and by quantifying these relationships through functions like the autocovariance, analysts can create more accurate models and predictions for a wide range of applications. This understanding also aids in distinguishing between random fluctuations and genuine patterns in the data.

## Goals of Time Series Analysis

### 1. **Detect the Trend (\(m_X(t)\))**

The trend in a time series represents a long-term increase or decrease in the data, which might be linear (a straight line trend) or nonlinear (such as exponential growth or decay). Identifying the trend helps in understanding the underlying direction of the data over time, which is crucial for making accurate forecasts and strategic decisions.

### 2. **Detect Seasonal Variation (\(s_X(t)\)) and Determine Its Period**

Seasonal variations refer to patterns that repeat over regular intervals and are predictable. These could be annual (like sales spikes during holidays), quarterly (like quarterly earnings reports in businesses), monthly, daily, etc. Detecting and accurately measuring the period of these variations is essential for effective planning and optimization in business processes, resource allocation, and more.

### 3. **Understand the Correlation Structure (\(\gamma_X(t,s)\))**

This involves studying how values at different times are related within the same time series. The autocovariance function, \(\gamma_X(t,s)\), measures the degree to which two points in the same series, separated by time \(t\) and \(s\), are linearly associated. Understanding this structure helps in modeling the series accurately, particularly in predicting future values based on past data.

### 4. **Understand the Correlation Structure Between Two Different Time Series**

Analyzing the relationship between different time series (for instance, the relationship between interest rates and stock prices) can provide insights into how changes in one series may influence another. This is particularly valuable in fields like economics, finance, and environmental studies.

### Applications in Forecasting

The primary aim in many time series analyses is to forecast future values. This is achieved by:

- **Estimating Trends and Seasonal Components**: Recognizing these components allows analysts to adjust the data for more accurate predictions.
- **Fitting Statistical Models to Capture Correlation Structures**: Models such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) are used to capture both the trend and autocorrelation in time series data, providing a framework for forecasting.

These models allow predictions to be made by extrapolating the detected dependencies, both deterministic and stochastic, from historical data.

### Practical Example: Macroeconomics

In macroeconomics, understanding business cycles—periods of expansion followed by contraction—is crucial. Analysts might need to:

- **Remove the Trend**: This isolates the long-term growth direction from the cyclical components.
- **Remove Seasonal Variations**: This clarifies the genuine economic cycles from regular seasonal effects.
- **Study Cyclical Variations**: After detrending and deseasonalizing, the focus shifts to understanding the remaining fluctuations to gauge business cycle phases, lengths, and amplitudes.

### Real World Data Examples

In real-world applications, time series data often contain a blend of deterministic and stochastic dependencies:

- **Deterministic Dependencies**: These are predictable and regular patterns like trends and seasonal cycles.
- **Stochastic Dependencies**: These are unpredictable changes that do not follow a fixed pattern but are dependent on the series' own past values and random disturbances.

### Two Example Analyses:

1. **Deterministic Dependency Analysis**: Might involve using trend lines or seasonal decomposition to highlight systematic changes in the data.
2. **Stochastic Dependency Analysis**: Could involve studying autocorrelation functions or fitting models like ARIMA to understand and predict based on the internal randomness of the series.

In sum, time series analysis is a robust tool for dissecting complex data sets to extract meaningful patterns and predictions, applicable across a broad spectrum of disciplines from economics to environmental science.

## Strong and Weak Stationarity

Time series analysis involves understanding and modeling the structure and behavior of data that is sequenced over time. Unlike traditional cross-sectional data analysis, time series data are inherently dependent, and their structure requires special statistical techniques to handle their temporal dependencies.

### Strong Stationarity

A time series is **strongly stationary** if its statistical properties do not change over time, regardless of the point in time at which you examine them. Specifically, a time series \(\{X_t\}\) is strongly stationary if the joint distribution of a set of observations taken from the series remains the same, even if shifted in time. This means that:

- \((X_t, \ldots, X_{t+n})\) is distributed identically to \((X_{t+h}, \ldots, X_{t+n+h})\) for any choice of \(n\), \(t\), and shift \(h\).
- This kind of stationarity requires that all aspects of the joint distribution (like moments of all orders, quantiles, etc.) are invariant under time shifts.

The practical implication is that under strong stationarity, any segment of the time series can be treated as representative of the whole. This makes the statistical analysis robust and simplifies modeling since the time series' properties are consistent over time.

### Weak Stationarity

Weak stationarity, also known simply as stationarity, is a less stringent condition compared to strong stationarity. A time series is **weakly stationary** if only the first two moments (the mean and variance) are constant over time, and the covariance between two points depends only on the time difference between those points, not on the actual time at which the points occur. Mathematically, a weakly stationary series must satisfy:

- The expected value \( \mathbf{E}[X_t] \) of the series is constant and equal to \( \mu_X \).
- The variance \( \mathsf{Var}(X_t) \) of the series is constant and equal to \( \sigma^2_X \).
- The covariance \( \mathsf{Cov}(X_s, X_t) \) between any two points depends only on the absolute difference in time \( |s-t| \) and is given by \( \gamma_X(|s-t|) \).

Weak stationarity is particularly important because it allows for the use of tools like autocorrelation functions and power spectra, which are fundamental in many time series analysis techniques, such as forecasting and modeling.

### Statistical Estimation and Inference in Time Series

### Relevance of Stationarity

Stationarity (both strong and weak) is crucial because it enables the reliable estimation of the series' characteristics using time averages. If a series is stationary, then the average values computed over time are meaningful and representative of the entire series. This is akin to how the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) and Central Limit Theorem (CLT) are used in cross-sectional data to justify the representativeness of sample averages and variances.

- **Estimating Population Parameters**: In time series data, if the process is stationary, then estimators based on time averages (like sample mean and autocorrelations) can reliably approximate the true population parameters.
- **Model Fitting and Forecasting**: With stationarity assumed, models fitted to historical data (like ARIMA) are presumed to be valid for future periods, thus aiding in forecasting.

### Handling Non-Stationarity

Many real-world time series are not stationary. Changes in mean, variance, or seasonality indicate non-stationarity, which complicates both analysis and forecasting. Techniques to handle non-stationary data include differencing the series, transforming the data (e.g., taking logarithms), or explicitly modeling the changing trends and seasonal patterns.

### Conclusion

Understanding whether a time series is stationary—either strongly or weakly—guides the selection of appropriate statistical methods for analysis and forecasting. Ensuring stationarity or appropriately handling non-stationarity is crucial for making accurate inferences and predictions from time series data.

## Examples

The observations about stationarity provide a comprehensive insight into its importance in time series analysis and the practical steps required to achieve a usable series for reliable statistical estimation and forecasting. Here, I'll connect these observations with practical examples and elaborate on how these principles apply in real-world scenarios.

### 1. **Fixed Joint Distribution and Predictive Modeling**

Stationarity, particularly strong stationarity, ensures that the statistical properties of the time series data do not change over time. This stability is crucial because it allows for the development of models that are generally applicable over time. For instance, if a model is fitted based on historical stock price data from 2000 to 2010, under the assumption of stationarity, one can reasonably expect this model to provide valid forecasts for future periods (e.g., 2011 onward). This is because the joint distribution of the data points, which captures the core dynamics and dependencies within the series, remains consistent.

**Practical Application Example**: In econometrics, models predicting inflation rates are typically built on historical data under the assumption that the fundamental economic mechanisms driving inflation remain constant over time, allowing these models to forecast future inflation effectively.

### 2. **Generalizations of LLN and CLT**

The application of the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in the context of dependent but identically distributed observations hinges on the decay of correlations between observations as the time gap increases. If correlations between observations diminish as the lag increases, then averages calculated from the data can converge in a manner similar to that of i.i.d. samples. This decay of correlation allows for effective estimation of population parameters, even though the data points are not strictly independent.

**Practical Application Example**: In climate science, temperature recordings over several years may exhibit dependencies from one day to the next, but temperatures from one season to another or year to year may become less correlated, allowing statistical methods that rely on the LLN and CLT to be effectively applied for long-term climate modeling and predictions.

### 3. **Handling Non-Stationarity: Trend and Seasonal Adjustments**

Since many practical time series exhibit trends (systematic increases or decreases) or seasonality (patterns that repeat at known intervals), they violate the stationarity requirements. To analyze such data, initial steps often involve detrending (removing long-term component) and deseasonalizing (removing repetitive fluctuations) the series. This transformation is crucial because it returns the series to a state where the assumptions of stationarity are more likely to hold, thus enabling more reliable statistical analysis and forecasting.

**Practical Application Example**: In retail sales, seasonal patterns dominate (e.g., higher sales during the holiday season), and there might be underlying trends (e.g., overall growth due to market expansion). Analysts often remove these components to study the core sales dynamics and predict future sales independent of these predictable patterns.

### Conclusion

In summary, stationarity is a foundational concept in time series analysis, essential for ensuring that the methods of statistical inference applied to such data are valid. Transforming non-stationary data into stationary data by removing trends, seasonality, and stabilizing variance allows analysts to apply powerful statistical tools and models that assume stationarity. This transformation process, although sometimes complex, is critical for making accurate predictions and informed decisions based on time series data.

## Differencing in Time Series

**Differencing** is a widely used technique in time series analysis to transform a non-stationary series into a stationary one. Stationarity is a crucial assumption in many time series modeling techniques, as it implies that the statistical properties of the series (mean, variance, autocorrelation, etc.) do not change over time.

### Key Concepts and Steps:

1. **Purpose of Differencing**:
    - **Remove Trends**: Differencing helps in eliminating trends (both linear and non-linear) from the series.
    - **Stabilize Variance**: It can help in stabilizing the variance over time.
    - **Stationarity**: It transforms the series to make it stationary, which is essential for many time series models, such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average).
2. **First Difference**:
The first difference of a time series \(X_t\) is defined as:
\[
\nabla X_t = X_t - X_{t-1}
\]
This operation effectively removes the linear trend from the series. If the original series has a trend, the differenced series will oscillate around a constant mean.
    
    **Example**:
    Given \( X_t = \alpha + \beta t + W_t \), where \( W_t \) is a stationary time series:
    \[
    \nabla X_t = X_t - X_{t-1} = (\alpha + \beta t + W_t) - (\alpha + \beta (t-1) + W_{t-1}) = \beta + W_t - W_{t-1}
    \]
    The differenced series \( \nabla X_t \) will be stationary if \( W_t \) is stationary.
    
3. **Second Difference**:
The second difference is the difference of the first differences, defined as:
\[
\nabla^2 X_t = \nabla X_t - \nabla X_{t-1} = (X_t - X_{t-1}) - (X_{t-1} - X_{t-2})
\]
This can remove non-linear trends (like quadratic trends) in the series.
    
    **Example**:
    Given \( X_t = 2X_{t-1} - X_{t-2} + W_t \):
    \[
    \nabla X_t = X_{t-1} - X_{t-2} + W_t
    \]
    \[
    \nabla^2 X_t = (X_{t-1} - X_{t-2} + W_t) - (X_{t-2} - X_{t-3} + W_{t-1}) = X_{t-1} - 2X_{t-2} + X_{t-3} + W_t - W_{t-1}
    \]
    
4. **Higher Order Differencing**:
Higher-order differencing can be applied to remove more complex trends. The \( p \)-th order difference is defined as:
\[
\nabla^p X_t = \nabla (\nabla^{p-1} X_t)
\]
The order of differencing required to achieve stationarity is denoted by \( d \) in ARIMA models (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average).
5. **Stationarity and Differencing**:
    - A time series is **integrated of order \( p \)**, denoted \( I(p) \), if it becomes stationary after differencing \( p \) times.
    - For example, a series that requires first differencing (one difference) to become stationary is \( I(1) \), while a series that requires second differencing is \( I(2) \).
6. **Effects on Autocorrelation**:
Differencing affects the autocorrelation structure of the series. For example:
    - The autocorrelation function (ACF) of the first differenced series will decay faster if the original series had a trend.

### Practical Application:

- **ARIMA Modeling**: Differencing is a critical step in ARIMA modeling. The "I" in ARIMA stands for "Integrated," indicating that the series has been differenced to achieve stationarity.
    - **ARIMA(p,d,q)**: Here, \( d \) represents the number of differences required to make the series stationary.
- **Seasonal Differencing**: For seasonal time series, seasonal differencing can be used:
\[
\nabla_s X_t = X_t - X_{t-s}
\]
where \( s \) is the seasonal period. This removes seasonal patterns from the data.

### Conclusion:

Differencing is a powerful technique in time series analysis for transforming non-stationary data into stationary data. It helps remove trends and stabilize variance, making the data suitable for various modeling techniques. Understanding and applying differencing correctly is crucial for accurate time series forecasting and analysis.

## Theory of Estimation on Stationary Time Series

Estimating the properties of a stationary time series is a fundamental task in time series analysis. Stationary time series have statistical properties that do not change over time, which simplifies the process of estimation and forecasting. Here, we discuss the theory behind the estimation of the mean, variance, and autocovariance function of a stationary time series.

### 1. **Stationary Time Series**

A time series \(\{X_t\}\) is said to be stationary if its statistical properties, such as mean, variance, and autocovariance, do not change over time. Formally, \(\{X_t\}\) is stationary if:

- The mean function \(\mu_X(t) = \mathbb{E}[X_t]\) is constant and does not depend on \(t\).
- The variance \(\sigma_X^2 = \text{Var}(X_t)\) is constant and does not depend on \(t\).
- The autocovariance function \(\gamma_X(h) = \text{Cov}(X_t, X_{t+h})\) depends only on the lag \(h\) and not on the specific time \(t\).

### 2. **Estimating the Mean**

The mean of a stationary time series is constant over time. The sample mean \(\hat{\mu}\) is an unbiased estimator of the true mean \(\mu\).

\[ \hat{\mu} = \overline{X_n} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^n X_t \]

- **Expectation**: The expected value of the sample mean is the true mean.
\[ \mathbb{E}[\hat{\mu}] = \mu \]
- **Variance**: The variance of the sample mean can be computed using the autocovariance function.
\[ \text{Var}(\hat{\mu}) = \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{t=1}^n \sum_{s=1}^n \text{Cov}(X_t, X_s) \]
Given that \(\text{Cov}(X_t, X_s) = \gamma_X(|t-s|)\), this can be simplified to:
\[ \text{Var}(\hat{\mu}) = \frac{1}{n^2} \left[ n \sigma_X^2 + 2 \sum_{h=1}^{n-1} (n-h) \gamma_X(h) \right] \]
where \(\gamma_X(0) = \sigma_X^2\).

### 3. **Estimating the Variance**

The sample variance \(\hat{\sigma}^2\) is an unbiased estimator of the true variance \(\sigma_X^2\).

\[ \hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^n (X_t - \hat{\mu})^2 \]

- **Expectation**: The expected value of the sample variance is the true variance.
\[ \mathbb{E}[\hat{\sigma}^2] = \sigma_X^2 \]
- **Bias Correction**: Often, for small sample sizes, a bias-corrected version is used:
\[ \hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{t=1}^n (X_t - \hat{\mu})^2 \]

### 4. **Estimating the Autocovariance Function**

The autocovariance function \(\gamma_X(h)\) measures the covariance between \(X_t\) and \(X_{t+h}\). For a stationary time series, it depends only on the lag \(h\).

\[ \hat{\gamma}(h) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n-h} (X_t - \hat{\mu})(X_{t+h} - \hat{\mu}) \]

- **Expectation**: The expected value of the sample autocovariance is the true autocovariance.
\[ \mathbb{E}[\hat{\gamma}(h)] = \gamma_X(h) \]

### 5. **Asymptotic Properties**

For large samples, under mild regularity conditions, the sample mean, sample variance, and sample autocovariance function have desirable asymptotic properties.

- **Law of Large Numbers (LLN)**: The sample mean converges in probability to the true mean.
\[ \hat{\mu} \xrightarrow{P} \mu \]
- **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**: The distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases.
\[ \sqrt{n} (\hat{\mu} - \mu) \xrightarrow{D} N(0, \sigma_X^2) \]
- **Consistency**: The estimators \(\hat{\mu}\), \(\hat{\sigma}^2\), and \(\hat{\gamma}(h)\) are consistent, meaning they converge in probability to the true values as the sample size \(n\) increases.

### 6. **Dependence and Variance of the Sample Mean**

The presence of autocorrelation affects the variance of the sample mean. For a stationary time series, the variance of the sample mean is given by:

\[ \text{Var}(\hat{\mu}) = \frac{\sigma_X^2}{n} + \frac{2}{n^2} \sum_{h=1}^{n-1} (n-h) \gamma_X(h) \]

This shows that positive autocorrelation (where \(\gamma_X(h) > 0\)) increases the variance of the sample mean, while negative autocorrelation (where \(\gamma_X(h) < 0\)) can decrease it.

### 7. **Practical Considerations**

- **Finite Sample Adjustments**: For small sample sizes, adjustments (like Bessel's correction) may be necessary to ensure unbiased estimation.
- **Ergodicity**: For practical purposes, the time averages used in estimation must be representative of the ensemble averages. This is often ensured by assuming ergodicity, where time averages converge to ensemble averages.

### Conclusion

Estimating the mean, variance, and autocovariance function of a stationary time series involves replacing theoretical expectations with sample averages. The sample estimators are typically unbiased and consistent under mild conditions. Autocorrelation affects the variance of the sample mean, with positive autocorrelation increasing the variance and negative autocorrelation decreasing it. Understanding these properties is crucial for accurate modeling and forecasting of time series data.

## Autocovariance Function

The autocovariance function (ACF) is a fundamental tool in time series analysis, used to understand the dependence structure of a time series. It provides insights into how the values of a time series are related to its past values, which is essential for identifying patterns, trends, and potential models for forecasting. The autocorrelation function (also often abbreviated as ACF) is closely related and serves as a normalized version of the autocovariance function.

### 1. **Definition of Autocovariance Function**

The autocovariance function measures the covariance between a time series and a lagged version of itself. For a stationary time series \(\{X_t\}\), the autocovariance function \(\gamma(h)\) at lag \(h\) is defined as:

\[ \gamma(h) = \text{Cov}(X_t, X_{t+h}) \]

For a stationary series, \(\gamma(h)\) depends only on the lag \(h\) and not on the time index \(t\). The autocovariance at lag \(h = 0\) is simply the variance of the series:

\[ \gamma(0) = \text{Var}(X_t) = \sigma^2 \]

### 2. **Autocorrelation Function**

The autocorrelation function (ACF) is the autocovariance function normalized by the variance of the series, providing a measure of the linear dependence between values at different lags. The autocorrelation function \(\rho(h)\) at lag \(h\) is defined as:

\[ \rho(h) = \frac{\gamma(h)}{\gamma(0)} = \frac{\text{Cov}(X_t, X_{t+h})}{\text{Var}(X_t)} \]

The ACF values range from -1 to 1:

- \(\rho(h) = 1\) indicates perfect positive correlation.
- \(\rho(h) = -1\) indicates perfect negative correlation.
- \(\rho(h) = 0\) indicates no correlation.

### 3. **Estimation of the Autocovariance and Autocorrelation Functions**

Given a time series \(\{X_t\}\) with \(n\) observations, the sample autocovariance function \(\hat{\gamma}(h)\) is estimated as:

\[ \hat{\gamma}(h) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n-h} (X_t - \bar{X})(X_{t+h} - \bar{X}) \]

where \(\bar{X}\) is the sample mean:

\[ \bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^n X_t \]

The sample autocorrelation function \(\hat{\rho}(h)\) is then:

\[ \hat{\rho}(h) = \frac{\hat{\gamma}(h)}{\hat{\gamma}(0)} \]

### 4. **Using ACF as a Diagnostic Tool**

The ACF is crucial for diagnosing the properties of a time series and selecting appropriate models for analysis and forecasting.

### **a. Detecting Non-Stationarity**

- **Trends**: If the ACF does not decay to zero but remains high for large lags, this indicates the presence of a trend, suggesting that the series is non-stationary.
- **Seasonality**: Regular patterns in the ACF (e.g., significant correlations at specific seasonal lags) suggest seasonal components in the time series.

### **b. Model Identification**

- **AR (Autoregressive) Models**: The ACF of an AR(p) model typically shows a gradual decline, often in an exponential or sinusoidal pattern.
- **MA (Moving Average) Models**: The ACF of an MA(q) model drops to zero after lag \(q\).
- **ARMA (Autoregressive Moving Average) Models**: The ACF of an ARMA model combines the behaviors of AR and MA models.

### **c. Residual Analysis**

- After fitting a time series model, the ACF of the residuals (differences between observed and predicted values) should ideally show no significant autocorrelation, indicating that the model has adequately captured the structure of the time series.

### 5. **Practical Application: Plotting the ACF**

Plotting the ACF is an essential step in exploratory data analysis. An ACF plot (also known as a correlogram) visually displays the autocorrelation coefficients at various lags, helping to identify patterns and decide on appropriate models.

### Example: Computing and Plotting the ACF with Python

Let's consider a practical example using Python to compute and plot the ACF for a given time series.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf

# Example time series
x = np.array([-1, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0, 1, 0])

# Plotting the ACF
plot_acf(x, lags=10)
plt.show()

```

### Interpreting the ACF Plot

In the plot generated by the code above:

- Each bar represents the autocorrelation coefficient at a different lag.
- The dashed lines are confidence intervals. Bars outside these lines indicate statistically significant autocorrelations.
- Patterns in the plot help identify trends, seasonality, and suitable models.

### Conclusion

The autocovariance and autocorrelation functions are indispensable tools in time series analysis. They provide insights into the dependence structure of the data, help diagnose non-stationarity, and guide the selection of appropriate models. Understanding and utilizing these functions is crucial for accurate time series modeling and forecasting.

## **Stationarity and non-stationarity**

The given condition states that for any integer \( k \), any integers \( h_1, \dots, h_k \), and any bounded and continuous function \( g \), the expectation

\[ \mathbf{E}[g(X_{t}, X_{t+h_1}, \dots, X_{t+h_k})] \]

does not depend on the time index \( t \). This implies that for every choice of \( t \), with the function \( g \) and integers \( h_1, \dots, h_k \) held fixed, the expectation is equal to the same value.

Let's analyze what this implies about the time series:

### Strong Stationarity

- **Strong Stationarity (Strict Stationarity)**: A time series \(\{X_t\}\) is said to be strongly stationary if the joint distribution of \((X_t, X_{t+h_1}, \dots, X_{t+h_k})\) does not depend on \( t \) for all \( t \), \( k \), and \( h_1, \dots, h_k \).
- The given condition implies that the joint distribution of \((X_t, X_{t+h_1}, \dots, X_{t+h_k})\) does not depend on \( t \). Therefore, the series is strongly stationary.

So, the correct answer includes:
\[ b) \text{the series is strongly stationary} \]

### Weak Stationarity

- **Weak Stationarity (Second-order Stationarity)**: A time series \(\{X_t\}\) is said to be weakly stationary if its mean \(\mu_X(t)\) is constant, its variance \(\sigma_X^2\) is constant, and its autocovariance function \(\gamma_X(h)\) depends only on the lag \( h \).
- Strong stationarity implies weak stationarity, but weak stationarity does not necessarily imply strong stationarity. Since the given condition implies strong stationarity, it also implies weak stationarity.

So, the correct answer includes:
\[ a) \text{the series is weakly stationary} \]

### Finite Dimensional Distributions

- **Finite Dimensional Distributions**: The condition implies that all finite dimensional distributions of the series \((X_t, X_{t+h_1}, \dots, X_{t+h_k})\) are invariant with respect to time \( t \). This is another way of stating that the series is strongly stationary, as strong stationarity means that the joint distribution of any set of observations does not depend on \( t \).

So, the correct answer includes:
\[ c) \text{all finite dimensional distributions of the series are constant over time} \]

### Autocovariance Function

- **Autocovariance Function**: For a stationary time series (both weak and strong stationarity), the autocovariance function \(\gamma_X(h)\) depends only on the time gap \( h \) and not on the specific time \( t \).

So, the correct answer includes:
\[ d) \text{autocovariance function depends only on the time gap} \]

### Summary

Given the condition, the correct statements about the time series are:
\[ a) \text{the series is weakly stationary} \]
\[ b) \text{the series is strongly stationary} \]
\[ c) \text{all finite dimensional distributions of the series are constant over time} \]
\[ d) \text{autocovariance function depends only on the time gap} \]

All the provided statements are true given the condition of the expectation.
