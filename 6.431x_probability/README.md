# 6.431x Probability

## 1. Course character and objectives

### Course objectives

**At a conceptual level:**

- Master the basic concepts associated with **probability models**
- Be able to translate models described in words to **mathematical models**
- Understand the main concepts and assumptions underlying **Bayesian and classical inference**
- Obtain some familiarity with the range of applications of **inference methods**

**At a more technical level:**

- Become familiar with basic and common **probability distributions**
- Learn how to use **conditioning** to simplify the analysis of complicated models
- Have facility manipulating **probability mass functions, densities,** and **expectations**
- Develop a solid understanding of the concept of **conditional expectation** and its role in inference
- Understand the power of **laws of large numbers** and be able to use them when appropriate
- Become familiar with the basis inference methodologies (for both **estimation** and **hypothesis testing**) and be able to apply them
- Acquire a good understanding of two **basic stochastic processes** (Bernoulli and Poisson) and their use in modeling
- Learn how to formulate simple dynamical models as **Markov chains** and analyze them

How do we do it:

- To achieve working knowledge, we:
    - cover more material than usual
    - capitalize on effective organization of the material

What this class is not:

- Not a lay science introduction/ overview of probability
- Not much in term of:
    - specific applications
    - computational exercises
    - demos

## 2. Why study probability?

1. Traditional scientific literacy: calculus, physics, chemistry, computers
2. Probability is also part of scientific literacy
    1. Complex systems → uncertainty
    2. Information society
    3. data/ info exit to reduce uncertainty

Where is probability useful? Everywhere!
